"Modelling dynamic behaviour of agents in a multiagent world: Logical analysis of Wh-questions and answers","M. Číhalová; M. Duží","Department of Philosophy, Palacký University of Olomouc, 771 80 Olomouc, Czech Republic; martina.cihalova@upol.cz; Department of Computer Science FEI, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava, 708 33 Ostrava, Czech Republic; marie.duzi@vsb.cz","Logic Journal of the IGPL","2 Mar 2023","2020","31","1","140","171","In a multiagent and multi-cultural world, the fine-grained analysis of agents’ dynamic behaviour, i.e. of their activities, is essential. Dynamic activities are actions that are characterized by an agent who executes the action and by other participants of the action. Wh-questions on the participants of the actions pose a difficult particular challenge because the variability of the types of possible answers to such questions is huge. To deal with the problem, we propose the analysis and classification of Wh-questions apt for agents’ communication in a multiagent system (MAS). Our proposal of such a system consists of agents who communicate with their fellow agents by messaging so that each autonomous agent, though resource-bounded, can make less or more rational decisions to meet its own and collective goals. In addition, by communicating with other fellow agents and their environment, agents can learn new concepts and enrich their ontology so that their behaviour is dynamic. We aim to make a general proposal of the system so that the ‘envelope’ of agents’ messages can be formalized in any MAS standard, be it The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents - Agent Communication Language (FIPA-ACL) or Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML). Yet, the content of messages is encoded in a formalized natural language. To this end, we apply Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL) with its procedural semanticswhich is particularly apt for a fine-grained analysis in which all the semantically salient features of natural language can be plausibly formalized. In this paper, we concentrate on analysing the content of query messages, particularly the content of those that encode Wh-questions and the answers to them. We also summarize TIL deduction system that makes it possible to answer such questions in an intelligent way. Linguists distinguish several subtypes of Wh-questions. Though the linguistic classification is helpful, it is not always suitable for agents’ communication and reasoning. We need the classification based on a logical analysis of Wh-questions so that the agents can infer possible answers to such questions rather than only looking for them by keywords. This paper aims to apply an appropriate classification of the logical types of Wh-questions and the analysis of such questions; we concentrate in particular on questions concerning the participants of activities. The application of these results to the analysis of processes and events based on verb valency frames is another novelty of the paper.","1368-9894","","10.1093/jigpal/jzab034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10057255","activity;communication of agents;ontology;Transparent Intensional Logic;Wh-questions and answers","","","","","","","","","2 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We present two kinds of semantics for our temporal justification logics, one based on interpreted systems and Fitting models and the other based on Mkrtychev models, and further, we establish soundness and completeness. We show that the internalization property holds in some of the temporal justification logics.

Schlechta in the ’90s with the aim of interpreting defaults via a generalized ‘most’ quantifier in first-order logic. They arguably represent the largest class of structures that qualify as a ‘collection of large subsets’ of a given index set $I$, in the sense that it is difficult to think of a weaker, but still plausible, definition of the concept. The notion of weak ultrafilter naturally emerges and has been used in epistemic logic and other knowledge representation (KR) applications. We provide a comprehensive exposition of weak filters and ultrafilters, comparing them with their classical counterparts that have found very important applications in logic, set theory and topology. Weak (ultra)filters capture the ‘majorities’ of social choice theory (which coincide with the commonsense understanding of a ‘large subset’) and in that respect, they outperform classical (ultra)filters in their role as ‘collections of large subsets’. Yet, they lack some of the elegant properties of classical (ultra)filters that make them an almost perfect match for logical theories. We investigate the extent to which some important classical results carry through in this new setting, and we focus on genuinely weak filters and genuinely weak ultrafilters. For weak ultrafilters, we proceed to provide concrete examples, answer questions of existence and characterize their construction. The class of weak (ultra)filters represents a genuine contribution of KR to set theory that might be of some interest to set theorists too and we initiate this study by providing a glimpse on natural set-theoretic questions.","1368-9894","","10.1093/jigpal/jzab030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10057252","Knowledge representation;default reasoning;set theory;ultrafilters","","","","","","","","","2 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is proved that BG satisfies the variable sharing property and is Halldén complete, while failing to satisfy the disjunction property. Sound and complete subscripted tableaux are presented for BG. An axiomatization (in the positive language extended with fusion) is presented, which is sound with respect to BG and, with respect to a related ternary relational semantics, complete; the problem of identifying a complete axiomatization for BG itself is left open.

It combines data‐driven marketing with business strategy and goals and requires a top‐down transformation of people, processes, technology, data, and culture. Adoption of data‐driven marketing for business‐to‐consumer (B2C) companies is well documented, and the further it develops with the aid of big data and artificial intelligence, the more data‐driven marketing in the B2C sphere will change from a unique competitive advantage into a requirement to compete. Marketing data analytics is the new battleground for marketers today. Adopting data‐first marketing not only positions marketers for success now, but also develops valuable skills that are scarce and will be increasingly sought after in the job market as all companies will go down this path.","","9781119701262","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10014005.pdf&bkn=10013929&pdfType=chapter","","Data analysis;Companies;Measurement;Stakeholders;Navigation;Internet;Industries","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

All too often, however, the CMO may not be involved in setting these organizational goals. In part this may stem from a marginalization of the marketing team as merely a cost center rather than a revenue‐generating arm of the company. To rectify this situation requires relationship‐building with the key stakeholders in the company, including the CEO, and the sales, finance, and IT leadership. This chapter addresses the first step in the data‐first marketing process: aligning the marketing team with strategic business teams and partners. These partnerships will not only help people to understand the goals of the business but also strengthen marketing's voice and help provide access to the data people need to evaluate marketing performance against business goals.","","9781119701262","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10013935.pdf&bkn=10013929&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Measurement;Stakeholders;Costs;Leadership;Internet;Software as a service","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The framework is designed to encompass a continuous improvement model while always keeping sight of the overarching business goals and the importance of using data throughout to craft better campaigns with measurable performance and value. There are three main phases of the campaign framework: Development, Execution, and Analysis, and each of these main phases has three steps. The Data‐First Marketing Campaign Framework begins with just preparation in the Development Phase. Laying the groundwork for the campaign requires three steps: build buyer personas; develop content assets and choose distribution and communication channels. Once the development phase is complete, people are ready to move on to the execution phase and set their campaign in motion. The analysis phase takes all that people have built in the campaign and begins to analyze measurements associated with campaign performance.","","9781119701262","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10013988.pdf&bkn=10013929&pdfType=chapter","","Organizations;Buildings;Task analysis;Standards organizations;Stakeholders;Solids;Social networking (online)","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter explains how to evaluate the data people need, where it may reside, and who owns that data. It covers ways to integrate the data to get a clearer picture of what the data is conveying. In order to really glean the data people need from the right sources to use for data‐first marketing, they will need to have a marketing technology (martech) stack in place. The martech stack is one's group of technologies – platforms, software, and tools – that allow him/her to execute, manage, and measure his/her marketing efforts. The chapter also addresses the importance of data governance and data policy to ensure a clean dataset, and covers how to create visualizations of the data to help convey the information more effectively.","","9781119701262","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10013957.pdf&bkn=10013929&pdfType=chapter","","Software;Automation;Lead;Social networking (online);Organizations;Internet;Current measurement","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

People can define data used by marketing in various ways – internal versus external, click‐based, social‐media based, and so on – but for the purposes of this book, the chapter looks at two categories, customer data and marketing operations data. Finally, the chapter gives some practical examples of marketing data analysis using the familiar sales and marketing funnel for lead nurturing with lead stages (e.g., MAL, MQL, SAL, and SQL) and how to glean insights for improving marketing performance and efficiency.","","9781119701262","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10013965.pdf&bkn=10013929&pdfType=chapter","","Data analysis;Data visualization;Companies;Government;Sports;Lead;Automation","","","","","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It also needs to adapt to the complex road environments in real-time. The global positioning system and the strap-down inertial navigation system are two common techniques in the field of vehicle localization. However, the localization accuracy, reliability and real-time performance of these two techniques can not satisfy the requirement of some critical ITS applications such as collision avoiding, vision enhancement and automatic parking. Aiming at the problems above, this paper aims to propose a precise vehicle ego-localization method based on image matching. Design/methodology/approach - This study included three steps, Step 1, extraction of feature points. After getting the image, the local features in the pavement images were extracted using an improved speeded up robust features algorithm. Step 2, eliminate mismatch points. Using a random sample consensus algorithm to eliminate mismatched points of road image and make match point pairs more robust. Step 3, matching of feature points and trajectory generation. Findings - Through the matching and validation of the extracted local feature points, the relative translation and rotation offsets between two consecutive pavement images were calculated, eventually, the trajectory of the vehicle was generated. Originality/value - The experimental results show that the studied algorithm has an accuracy at decimeter-level and it fully meets the demand of the lane-level positioning in some critical ITS applications.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-12-2019-0015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999189","Feature extraction;Image matching;Intelligent transportation systems;Intelligent vehicles;Position measurement","Location awareness;Roads;Global Positioning System;Feature extraction;Satellites;Trajectory;Real-time systems","","","","","","","","26 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The authors used a case-control approach to estimate the prevalence and the population attributable risk percentage. The mixed logistic regression model is used to evaluate the correlation between different driver demographic characteristics (age, driving experience or their combination) and the crash risk regarding cell phone engagements, as well as the correlation among the likelihood of the cell phone engagement during the driving, multiple driver demographic characteristics (gender, age and driving experience) and environment conditions. Findings - Senior drivers face an extremely high crash risk when distracted by cell phone during driving, but they are not involved in crashes at a large scale. On the contrary, cell phone usages account for a far larger percentage of total crashes for young drivers. Similarly, experienced drivers and experienced-middle-aged drivers seem less likely to be impacted by the cell phone while driving, and cell phone engagements are attributed to a lower percentage of total crashes for them. Furthermore, experienced, senior or male drivers are less likely to engage in cell phone-related secondary tasks while driving.

A double-Gaussian distribution was introduced to deduce the lane-change trajectories of tractor and trailer coupling characteristics of intelligent vehicles and roads. With different steering and braking maneuvers, minimum safe distances were modeled and calculated. Considering safety and ergonomics, the authors invested multilevel self-driving modes that serve as the basis of decision-making for vehicle lane-change. Furthermore, a combined controller was designed by feedback linearization and single-point preview optimization to ensure the path tracking and robust stability. Specialized hardware in the loop simulation platform was built to verify the effectiveness of the designed method.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed a dynamic programming model that optimally schedules the bus operating speed at road sections and multiple signal timing plans at intersections to improve bus schedule adherence. First, the bus route was partitioned into three types of sections: stop, road and intersection. Then, transit agencies can control buses in real time based on all collected information; i.e. control bus operating speed on road sections and adjust the signal timing plans through signal controllers to improve the schedule adherence in connected bus environment. Finally, bus punctuality at the downstream stop and the saturation degree deviations of intersections were selected as the evaluation criteria in optimizing signal control plans and bus speeds jointly. Findings - An illustrative case study by using a bus rapid transit line in Jinan city was performed to verify the proposed model. It revealed that based on the proposed strategy, the objective value could be reduced by 73.7%, which indicated that the punctuality was highly improved but not to incur excessive congestion for other vehicular traffic.

The incoming data can be sampled at rates ranging from one Hertz (or even lower) to hundreds of Hertz. Failing to capture substantial changes in vehicle movements over time by ""undersampling"" can cause loss of information and misinterpretations of the data, but ""oversampling"" can waste storage and processing resources. The purpose of this study is to empirically explore how micro-driving decisions to maintain speed, accelerate or decelerate, can be best captured, without substantial loss of information. Design/methodology/approach - This study creates a set of indicators to quantify the magnitude of information loss (MIL). Each indicator is calculated as a percentage to index the extent of information loss (EIL) in different situations. An overall information loss index named EIL is created to combine the MIL indicators. Data from a driving simulator study collected at 20 Hertz are analyzed (N = 718,481 data points from 35,924s of driving tests). The study quantifies the relationship between information loss indicators and sampling rates. Findings - The results show that marginally more information is lost as data are sampled down from 20 to 0.5 Hz, but the relationship is not linear. With four indicators of MILs, the overall EIL is 3.85 per cent for 1-Hz sampling rate driving behavior data. If sampling rates are higher than 2 Hz, all MILs are under 5 per cent for importation loss. Originality/value - This study contributes by developing a framework for quantifying the relationship between sampling rates, and information loss and depending on the objective of their study, researchers can choose the appropriate sampling rate necessary to get the right amount of accuracy.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-10-2019-0010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999203","Driver behaviours and assistance;Sensor data processing;Information loss;Instantaneous driving decisions;Sampling rate;Undersampling","Behavioral sciences;Safety;Data models;Global Positioning System;Connected vehicles;Publishing;Meteorology","data handling;driver information systems;Global Positioning System;sampling methods","data misinterpretation;data oversampling;driving behavior data sampling;driving simulator;driving test;frequency 0.5 Hz;frequency 20 Hz;Global Positioning System devices;information loss index;information loss indicators;information loss magnitude;microdriving decisions;MIL indicators;on-board diagnostic systems;sampling rate;vehicle movement","","","","","","26 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

By introducing the theory of moving block section for high-speed train control, a speed guidance model based on the quasi-moving block speed guidance (QMBSG) is proposed to direct platoon including human-driven vehicles and connected vehicles (CV) through the intersection coordinately. Design/methodology/approach - In this model, the green time of the intersection is divided into multiple block intervals according to the minimal safety headway. Connected vehicles can pass through the intersection by following the block interval using the QMBSG model. The block interval is assigned dynamically according to the traveling relation of HV and CV, when entering the communication range of the intersection. To validate the comprehensive guidance effect of the proposed model, a general evaluation function (GEF) is established. Compared to CVs without speed guidance, the simulation results show that the GEF of QMBSG model has an obvious improvement. Findings - Compared to CVs without speed guidance, the simulation results show that the GEF of QMBSG model has an obvious improvement. Also, compared to the single intersection speed guidance model, the GEF value of the QMBSG model improves over 17.1%. To further explore the guidance effect, the impact of sensitivity factors of the CVs' environment, such as intersection environment, communication range and penetration rate (PR) is analyzed. When the PR reaches 75.0%, the GEF value will change suddenly and the model guidance effect will be significantly improved. This paper also analyzes the impact of the length of block interval under different PR and traffic demands. It is found that the proposed model has a better guidance effect when the length of the block section is 2 s, which facilitates traffic congestion alleviation of the intersection in practice. Originality/value - Based on the aforementioned discussion, the contributions of this paper are three-fold. Based on the traveling information of HV/CV and the signal phase and timing plans, the QMBSG model is proposed to direct platoon consisting of HV and CV through the intersection coordinately, by following the block interval assigned dynamically. Considering comprehensively the indexes of mobility, safety and environment, a GEF is provided to evaluate the guidance effect of vehicles through the intersection. Sensitivity analysis is carried out on the QMBSG model. The key communication and traffic parameters of the CV environment are analyzed, such as path attenuation, PR, etc. Finally, the effect of the length of block interval is explored.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-01-2020-0002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999191","Simulation analysis;Block interval;Connected vehicle;Quasi-moving block;Speed guidance","Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Real-time systems;Mathematical models;Simulation;Green products;Connected vehicles","","","","1","","","","26 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The goal of any hacker is to gain access to systems and servers. A penetration (pen) tester's goal is to thwart all hackers ‐ or at least deter them as much as possible ‐ so they walk away with minimal or unusable information. Burp Suite by portswigger.net is a web security pen testing tool that allows a pen tester to conduct web vulnerability scans as well as other types of scans to identify issues with cross site scripting, Structured Query Language injection, cross site request forgery, and other advanced web attacks. <i>Vectors</i>, paths and places where hackers can exploit a weakness, are just as important as the penetration itself. Wireshark gives a tester the ability to find vulnerable vectors. Spoofing, eavesdropping, key logging, card skimming, and even USB drives are all ways hackers use to attack an organization for the purpose of collecting data.","","9781119577478","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953381.pdf&bkn=9953204&pdfType=chapter","","Computer hacking;Penetration testing;Computer architecture;Testing;Security;Logic gates;Eavesdropping","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Backing Up Your Data","D. Lowe",NA,"Networking For Dummies","","2020","","","361","375","This chapter covers the ins and outs of creating a solid backup plan. Having data backed up is the cornerstone of any disaster recovery plan. To get network administrators plan started, the chapter suggests them begin with the most widely accepted rule for creating a good backup plan, called the 3‐2‐1 rule. An important factor to consider when determining how often administrators should back up their data is determining how long each backup takes to complete. This period of time is called the <i>backup window</i>. If network administrators plan on backing up the data on their network server's hard drives, they obviously need some type of media on which to back up the data. This media is called the <i>backup target</i> because it's the location to which their backup data is sent. Windows Server comes with a rudimentary backup program called Windows Server Backup.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953305.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Media;Companies;Servers;Cyberattack;Storage area networks;Software;Costs","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter shows users how to turn their humble Windows client computer into a server computer so that other computers on their network can use their printer and any folders that users decide they want to share. Windows includes an alternative method of sharing files on the network: the Public folder. Files users save in this folder can be accessed by other users on the network and by any user who logs on to users' computer. Sharing a printer is much more traumatic than sharing a hard drive.

Kirsch",NA; NA,"Cloud Computing For Dummies","","2020","","","165","176","Managing the deployment and operation of applications and other workloads is critical for meeting customer expectations for availability and performance of the software tools they depend on every day. This chapter discusses the nature of cloud applications and workloads, and the challenges and approaches for managing workloads in multicloud environments. Typical batch workloads perform repetitive tasks such as backups and process large volumes of data. Public cloud security has become as trustworthy as on‐premises security, so cost‐benefit analysis may recommend that complex transactional workloads are deployed to a public cloud. High performance workloads are well suited for specialized public clouds optimized for performance. Application programming interfaces (APIs) enable a software product or service to work with another product or service. Likewise, in multicloud workload management, companies offer capabilities to create customizable templates that allow developers to make allowances for the differences in APIs and thus are able to deploy and migrate workloads.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953523.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Software as a service;Servers;Databases;Task analysis;Virtual machining;Security","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Most people use cloud services whether they're aware of doing so or not. Cloud computing is popular because it's convenient for the end user and cheaper for the enterprise business. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, a research laboratory in the United States, developed the standard definition of cloud computing. The cloud's rapid scalability and elasticity are capabilities that only the largest companies in the world can afford to manage on their own. The term <i>economies of scale</i> means that a business that purchases its internal resources at a larger volume can pass along savings to its customers. In Azure nomenclature, <i>deployment</i> refers to people's provisioning resources in the Azure public cloud.","","9781119612186","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953417.pdf&bkn=9953206&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Servers;NIST;Data centers;Computational modeling;Companies;Biological system modeling","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

One of the primary benefits of the abstraction of the PaaS model is that it allows businesses to rapidly transform their software to meet new customer requirements. PaaS computing environments are a technique for managing the cloud‐based software development and deployment life cycle. Public PaaS clouds provide the shortest path to development and deployment of a Software as a service application. PaaS platforms are generally much less complicated than IaaS platforms in their configuration and management, tasks which are often handled by the IT, development, or operations teams.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953460.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Software;Operating systems;Platform as a service;Containers;NIST;Transforms;Training","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Kirsch",NA; NA,"Cloud Computing For Dummies","","2020","","","73","85","One of the most important benefits businesses gain from cloud computing is the ability to modularize application services so that they can be linked together to create a cohesive environment. The new generation of agile application development and deployment means software services can be developed and deployed virtually anywhere. This chapter discusses what it means to transform one's computing environment into independent services that are supported by containers and container orchestration. The techniques needed to create these new services are defined in a new generation of software development and deployment—Platform as a Service (PaaS). The combination of microservices, containers, container management, and PaaS provides the agility and flexibility to turn cloud computing into a platform for the future. The idea of cloud native was codified by The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, an organization founded in 2015 under the auspices of the Linux Foundation.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953308.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Microservice architectures;Containers;Codes;Software;Servers;Hardware","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A network administrator “administers” a network: installing, configuring, expanding, protecting, upgrading, tuning, and repairing the network. A network administrator takes care of the network hardware and the network software. Large networks tend to be volatile: Users come and go, equipment fails, software chokes, and life in general seems to be one crisis after another. Smaller networks are much more stable. The larger the network, the more technical support it needs. The job of managing a network definitely requires computer skills, but it isn't entirely a technical job. Managing network technology is the easiest part of network management. Network managers need certain tools to get their jobs done. The major software vendors such as Microsoft and Cisco provide certification programs for their own equipment and software. CompTIA, a nonprofit industry trade association, provides the best‐known vendor‐neutral certification.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953496.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Software;Servers;Task analysis;Network operating systems;Viruses (medical);Inspection;Hardware","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Managing security in the cloud needs to be viewed as a shared responsibility across the organization. This chapter examines the security risks and governance considerations for companies working in hybrid cloud environments. Ultimately, education is key to ensuring that everyone in the organization has an understanding of his or her roles and responsibilities with regard to security. The cloud security alliance divides application security into different areas, including securing the software development life cycle in the cloud; authentication, authorization, and compliance; identity management, application authorization management, application monitoring, application penetration testing, and risk management. An effective cloud security strategy requires enforcement and accountability. Cloud governance is a shared responsibility between the user of cloud services and the cloud provider.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953498.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Security;Companies;Servers;Cloud computing security;Encryption;NIST","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter covers a few of the most important ones, such as, elasticity, flexibility, agility, innovation, and operational efficiency. When users start using cloud applications, managing identity on each of their applications will become a problem. An obvious place to start with unifying user's identity management is Azure Active Directory.

It describes the relationship between physical computing resources and IaaS, covers scalability and other cloud capabilities of IaaS platforms, and discusses the financial models with IaaS. Software as a Service applications are easily accessed from the cloud, and developers know more about the hardware they need than IT does. Service level agreements are also valuable to consumers who are using IaaS resources to build software that will run in the cloud. The private cloud is becoming increasingly important to organizations that want the elasticity, self‐service provisioning, and manageability of the public cloud but want those services behind the firewall.

Shared folders can be set up with restrictions on how computer users can use them. For example, they may be granted full access to some shared folders so that they can copy files to or from them, delete files on them, or create or remove folders on them. After users know which shared network folders are available, they may wonder what they are supposed to do with them. This chapter describes four good uses for a network folder. If computer users often access a particular shared folder, they may want to use the special trick known as mapping to access the shared folder more efficiently. <i>Mapping</i> assigns a drive letter to a shared folder.

Professional server computers typically include redundancy in all the key systems—duplicate power supplies, duplicate network ports, duplicate disk controllers, and often even duplicate CPUs and motherboards. A professionally installed cable infrastructure will last much longer than the computers it services, and will be considerably more reliable. The fastest way to blow the network users' accounts to kingdom come is to turn off a server computer while users are logged on. Restarting it by pressing its reset button can have the same disastrous effect. Some users make the unfortunate assumption that the network somehow represents an efficient and organized bureaucracy worthy of their trust. One of the most disastrous mistakes to make on a network server is to let it run out of disk space.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953511.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Printers;Internet;Wireless sensor networks;Communication system security;Wireless networks;Wireless access points","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In addition to firewalls and security software, it's vital that network administrators train their users in the ways of cybersecurity. Their users are the final and best line of defense against cyberthreats. Network envy is a common malady among network managers. There's no reason that the network should be down for two days just because a cable breaks. Always make sure that network administrators have at least a minimal supply of network spare parts on hand.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953485.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Training;Software;Motion pictures;Firewalls (computing);Schedules;Resists","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The right planning strategy is imperative to getting their plan to be operational. Cloud computing can offer a dramatic change in the pace and style of computing as well as business strategy. This chapter provides an idea about what to expect as professional begin their journey, along with the important issues they need to consider. In the initial decade of cloud computing, very few businesses had a strategy. An overall cloud computing strategy is like any other business strategy; it must be planned within the context of the business goals and objectives. Cloud providers typically offer public cloud services to a range of constituents. In some cases, the services are designed to create a high level of service and security for corporations.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953377.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Business;Planning;Companies;Industries;Costs;Data centers","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter details the roles a pen tester can hold in a company. The pen tester's role is to penetrate and to ethically hack to find weaknesses within a company's IT security program. <i>Crowdsourcing</i> is a form of security where pen testing is done via group‐based team efforts of enthusiasts for the purpose of testing systems managed by enterprises much the same way a constant group may. In‐house security operations versus consulting services for hire are generally how pen testers work in the field. Mobile technology is also a must‐know endpoint technology quickly replacing the desktops and other devices. Cloud is another boundary IT security pros are trying to cross in the world of security and pen testing.","","9781119577478","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953519.pdf&bkn=9953204&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Testing;Penetration testing;Certification;Organizations;Computer hacking;Companies","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter introduces <i>Ethernet</i>, the most common system of network cabling for small networks. It examines how to work with switches, which create the necessary interconnections so that all user's computers can talk to each other. Ethernet is a standardized way of connecting computers to create a network. RJ‐45 connectors for twisted‐pair cables aren't too difficult to attach if users have the right crimping tool. A <i>crossover cable</i> can directly connect two devices without a switch. When computer users use twisted‐pair cable to wire a network, they don't plug the computers into each other. Instead, each computer plugs into a separate device called a <i>switch</i>. Some switches, called <i>stackable switches</i>, can be expanded by adding additional switch modules that add additional ports to the switch.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953415.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Ethernet;Optical fiber cables;Cable TV;Computers;Stars;Standards;Network topology","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Operational performance, security, economics, and flexibility all have a great impact on an organization's cloud strategy. Striking the right balance among public cloud services, private cloud, and the data center requires a pragmatic planning process. Planning must take into account the needs of a variety of business units as well as an understanding of the future business strategy. A customer‐facing financial application in the heavily regulated financial industry may be better suited for a private cloud environment. Some pragmatic workloads fit perfectly into the infrastructure as a service model. Cloud pricing changes constantly which makes it difficult for a business to be able to do the type of financial planning that management requires.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953379.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Costs;Companies;Software as a service;Data centers;Biological system modeling;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It shows the networking administrators how to come up with a networking plan that's every bit as good as the plan that a network consultant would charge thousands of dollars for. The chapter provides some general thoughts to keep in mind while networking administrators create their network plan: don't rush the plan, write down the network plan, and keep the plan up to date. One of the first steps in planning networking administrators' network is making sure that they understand why they want the network in the first place. Several software programs inspect various aspects of a computer, such as the CPU type and speed, amount of RAM, and the size of the computer's hard drives.

This chapter talks about several ways that a network can provide shared disk storage. A solid state drive uses integrated circuits to store data in electronic memory rather than on magnetic spinning disks. The most common network technology used in storage area network is called Fibre Channel; it runs at speeds considerably higher than most Ethernet networks. The chapter shows how to configure Windows Server 2019 to run as a file server. The access control list (ACL) identifies which users and groups can access the object and specifies what level of access each user or group has. A folder's ACL may specify that one group of users can read files in the folder, whereas another group can read and write files in the folder, and a third group is denied access to the folder.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953348.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Disk drives;Spinning;Head;Arrays;Magnetic heads;Clocks;Tracking","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Hardening Your Network","D. Lowe",NA,"Networking For Dummies","","2020","","","337","347","This chapter presents an overview of three basic techniques for securing computer users' network's Internet connection: controlling access via a firewall, detecting viruses with antivirus software, and fixing security flaws with software patches. All network traffic into and out of the local area network must pass through the firewall, which prevents unauthorized access to the network. The term perimeter is sometimes used to describe the location of a firewall on computer users's network. Packet filters are the least expensive type of firewall. However, packet filtering has a number of flaws that knowledgeable hackers can exploit. A firewall with Stateful packet inspection looks at packets in groups rather than individually. One of the annoyances that every network manager faces is applying software patches to keep the operating system and other software up to date.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953389.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Firewalls (computing);Internet;Servers;Filtering;Computers;Operating systems;Computer hacking","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Cable ties, those little plastic zip things that one wrap around a group of cables and pull to tighten, can go a long way toward helping keep the network cables neat and organized. Even better than cable ties are rolls of Velcro, which one can cut to the appropriate length to neatly bundle up the cables. One can keep the replacement parts on hand when the need arises such as power supplies, monitors, keyboards, battery backup units, as well as replacement batteries, RAM, video cables, sound cards, and case fans.

Subvert attacks bring their own intense brand of nastiness to the security equation. This chapter examines the tools for conducting a pen test to simulate subvert attacks, which are attacks that get past security controls. Many subvert attacks originate from malware. Because of this, the best tool pen testers have in their arsenal is antivirus software platforms used in their enterprise. There is no better tool used to probe, map, and identify holes and ways through them than Nmap. Nessus, Metasploit, and even Kali offer many tools to perform this function, but Nmap itself is the go‐to for this type of attack. One of the main options for a hacker is to gain access to a host computer through <i>phishing</i>, which is a technical version of social engineering.

Azure AD is a multitenant, hosted identity store used by Azure as well as other Microsoft cloud services, including Office 365, Dynamics 365, Intune and Enterprise Mobility. The Azure AD tenant can exist separately from a subscription, but Azure won't let developers deploy any resources unless and until the Azure AD tenant is linked to at least one subscription. An identity store is worthless without user and group accounts. User accounts represent individual identities, whereas groups aggregate multiple user accounts for easier management. All subscription owners start with their Azure AD tenant at the Free pricing tier. Microsoft uses a role‐based access control authorization model.

The <i>virtual network</i>(VNet) is a strong isolation and communications boundary in Azure. The address space is the top‐level private IPv4 address range that the developer define for their VNet. All network communications within a VNet take place only in Azure. The most common architectural pattern places each application tier in its own subnet — perhaps one subnet for the web front‐end tier, one for the business logic tier, and one for the data tier. Azure is a metered service, and every service has a predefined capacity limit. One reason why performing Azure deployments programmatically is considered more efficient than doing it in the Azure portal is that developers can specify all aspects of the deployment.

This chapter provides the knowledge information technology (IT) professionals need to become the cop of their network: the goals of good pen testers, the importance of ongoing scanning, and how tell the good hackers from the bad. The ultimate goal to pen testing is to test IT professional's technology assets for their security, their safeguards, and controls by trying to penetrate through any configured defenses. Risk is another important word to define prior to discussing vulnerabilities. A <i>risk register</i> is a list of known risks and vulnerabilities that IT professionals compile as they scan, assess, penetrate, and test. Vulnerabilities are a type of risk that can be rated and used as a recorded artifact that can be logged, reviewed, and corrected by people who are responsible for its correction.","","9781119577478","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953412.pdf&bkn=9953204&pdfType=chapter","","Testing;Security;Registers;Industries;Penetration testing;Monitoring;Computer hacking","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The most common type of email scam is called an advance‐fee scam, in which people are promised a large reward or prize in the future for advancing a relatively small amount of money now, in the form of a wire transfer or money order. Antispam software examines all incoming email with the intent of distinguishing between spam and legitimate email. Depending on how the software is configured, email identified as spam is deleted, moved to a separate location, or simply marked as possible spam by adding a tag to the email's subject line. The antispam appliance may provide other security features, such as antivirus and firewall protection.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953518.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Unsolicited e-mail;Postal services;Phishing;Credit cards;Computer viruses;Passwords;Costs","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Many public clouds also offer Platform as a Service (PaaS) capabilities where the operating system is hidden and deployed applications use only PaaS services. This chapter looks at three types of public clouds: Commercial public clouds, Open community clouds and Public clouds that have been designed for use by the U.S. government. Three types of integration are relevant to assembling systems of applications and services: Integration at the service level, Integration at the data level, and Integration at the application level. All three types of integration benefit from application programming interface and standards as they often represent the points of integration between services, applications, and systems. Data level integrations require domain experts to understand the structure and meaning of the data that must be integrated.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953378.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Software as a service;Business;Social networking (online);Security;Service level agreements;Advertising","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Very few companies are using a single cloud or computing platform to meet all their needs. A variety of standards are important for cloud computing. This chapter discusses the standards that are becoming imperative to the wide adoption of cloud computing. Standards developing organizations and standards setting organizations can be differentiated by how they create a standard. One of the most important aspects of interoperability is the ability to enable applications to exchange data in a multicloud or on‐premises data center. The distributed management task force has been around for nearly 30 years and may best be known for its common information model, which is a common view of IT equipment. National Institute of Standards and Technology formed its cloud computing group to help federal agencies understand cloud computing. The storage networking industry association is responsible for the cloud data management interface.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953382.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Standards;Cloud computing;Interoperability;Standards organizations;Organizations;Industries;Software","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Lowe",NA,"Networking For Dummies","","2020","","","167","194","This chapter is a brief introduction to virtualization, with an emphasis on using it to leverage the network server hardware to provide more servers using less hardware. The basic idea behind virtualization is to use software to simulate the existence of hardware. Like a real computer, each virtual machine requires an operating system to do productive work. At the core of virtualization is a hypervisor, a layer of software that manages the creation and execution of virtual machines. In a typical virtual environment, the host computers can be connected to disk storage in several distinct ways: local disk storage, storage area network, and network attached storage. The virtual network connects the virtual machines to each other and to the physical network. The chapter provides the step‐by‐step instructions of activating Hyper‐V, and creating and using virtual machines. In Hyper‐V, each virtual machine runs within an isolated space called a partition.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953306.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","Virtual machining;Virtualization;Virtual machine monitors;Operating systems;Hardware;Disk drives;Servers","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter looks at the world of SaaS applications and how they work in a multicloud world. SaaS applications can meet increasing demands by using scalable resources that the cloud provides or designs into the application. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, an organization that drives adoption of the cloud‐native programming paradigm, focuses on container and microservice technologies. In order to create a more feature‐rich application, some SaaS vendors have turned their application into a platform upon which partners and independent software vendors (ISVs) can build applications that extend the SaaS platform. Partners and ISVs can be broken into two general categories: smaller startups and larger, established companies. A SaaS platform should document its application programming interfaces and state how long they will be supported.","","9781119546757","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953280.pdf&bkn=9953200&pdfType=chapter","","Software as a service;Business;Companies;Costs;Codes;Customer relationship management;Maintenance engineering","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The most immediately noticeable feature of the iPhone is its lack of a keyboard. Instead, nearly the entire front surface of the iPhone is a high‐resolution, touch‐sensitive LCD display. Crucial differences exist between Android phones and iPhones. The most important difference — in many ways, the only important difference — is that Android phones are based on an open source OS derived from Linux, which can be extended and adapted to work on a wide variety of hardware devices from different vendors. The Android OS is an open source OS managed by the Open Handset Alliance.

There are three pillars that the network administrators must consider as part of their cybersecurity plan. These include: prevention technology, recovery technology, and the human firewall. The chapter presents two approaches to security: open door policy and closed door approach. The first level of security in any computer network is physical security. Physical security is important for workstations but vital for servers. The chapter describes some of the steps that the network administrators can take to strengthen their network's use of user accounts. One of the most important aspects of network security is the use of passwords. The administrator is responsible for setting up the network's security system. Many networks automatically create an administrator user account when administrators install the network software.

This chapter introduces the most important concepts of TCP/IP. It examines the binary system, the details of how IP addresses are constructed, how subnetting works, and how two of the most important TCP/IP services — Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS)—work. If a domain name ends with a trailing dot, that trailing dot represents the root domain, and the domain name is said to be a fully qualified domain name. Client computers don't need much configuration to work properly with DNS. The client must have the address of at least one DNS server. Usually, this address is supplied by DHCP, so if the client is configured to obtain its IP address from a DHCP server, it also obtains the DNS server address from DHCP.","","9781119748670","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9953501.pdf&bkn=9953201&pdfType=chapter","","TCPIP;Protocols;Computers;Internet;Media Access Protocol;Standards;Object recognition","","","","","","","","16 Nov 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In a wireless network, the computers use wireless network adapters that communicate via radio signals. All modern laptop computers have built‐in wireless network adapters, as do most desktop computers. Usually, special licensing software that runs on one of the network's server computers keeps track of how many people are currently using the software. This type of license is frequently used with more specialized software, such as accounting systems or computer drafting systems. The network server features that are built into desktop versions of Windows aren't particularly efficient because these versions of Windows weren't designed primarily to be network servers. Mainframe computers used to be the dominant computers in the workplace. Personal computers severed the tie to the centralized control of the mainframe computer.

This chapter discusses the important elements of the cybersecurity policy framework. An organization's <i>information security policy</i> framework contains a series of documents designed to describe the organization's cybersecurity program. The scope and complexity of these documents vary widely, depending on the nature of the organization and its information resources. These frameworks generally include four different types of document: policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines. The chapter discusses the differences between each of these document types. Quality control procedures verify that an organization has sufficient security controls in place and that those security controls are functioning properly. <i>Audits</i> are formal reviews of an organization's security program or specific compliance issues conducted on behalf of a third party.","","9781119684084","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932383.pdf&bkn=9932136&pdfType=chapter","","Standards organizations;Organizations;Monitoring;Information security;Passwords;Biomedical imaging;NIST","","","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It also discusses threat classification, threat actors, and attack frameworks and describes threats. Open source threat intelligence is threat intelligence that is acquired from publicly available sources. Commercial security vendors, government organizations, and other security‐centric organizations also create and use proprietary, or closed source, intelligence. Zero‐day threats, or threats that exploit an unknown security vulnerability, are one of the most common types of unknown threats. Advanced persistent threat actors, particularly those with nation‐state resources, commonly acquire zero‐day exploit information and leverage it to their advantage. Proactive threat hunting is often triggered by new data or tools that inspire threat analysts or security professionals to establish a hypothesis about a new threat, a new threat actor, or a new type of threat.","","9781119684084","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932389.pdf&bkn=9932136&pdfType=chapter","","Feeds;Standards organizations;Blocklists;Viruses (medical);Reliability;Government;Computer viruses","","","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phase of incident response moves the organization from the primarily passive incident response activities that take place during the Detection and Analysis phase to more active undertakings. Cybersecurity analysts often use <i>network segmentation</i> as a proactive strategy to prevent the spread of future security incidents. Cybersecurity analysts may instead decide that it is necessary to use stronger <i>isolation</i> practices to cut off an attack. Two primary isolation techniques may be used during a cybersecurity incident response effort: isolating affected systems and isolating the attacker. Removal of compromised systems from the network is the strongest containment technique in the cybersecurity analyst's incident response toolkit.","","9781119684084","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932400.pdf&bkn=9932136&pdfType=chapter","","Computer security;Organizations;NIST;Firewalls (computing);Virtual LAN;Internet;IP networks","","","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Many more workplace attackers had contacts with law enforcement that did not lead to charges. With respect to the active shooter scenario, the same advance mental preparation is required. Clearly, avoiding a dangerous situation is the preferred option.","","9781119574392","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9898645.pdf&bkn=9898145&pdfType=chapter","","Law enforcement;Employment;Behavioral sciences;Training;Security;Mental health;History","","","","","","","","21 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Running a Successful Security Business Function","D. A. Katz; I. Caspi",NA; NA,"Executive's Guide to Personal Security","","2020","","","195","203","To run a successful security function within any organization, additional skills and knowledge are required. What are these skills? Why they are important? And what knowledge is required to achieve the most dramatic results? This chapter explains all of these. It discusses specific skills and critical success factors and reviews several trends that have occurred over the last few years that have affected the corporate security function and understanding the type of challenges these trends are creating. To properly cover the expanded role and increased responsibilities of a centralized security program, the chief security officer (CSO) must have not simply a wide range of technical security expertise across different disciplines but also a broad set of business and management skills. In order to be successful, the CSO must have excellent interpersonal and communications skills with a solid understanding of the company’s core functions.","","9781119574392","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9898647.pdf&bkn=9898145&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Companies;Safety;Market research;Law;Information security;Resistance","","","","","","","","21 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The hijacking guidelines published by the government remind readers to maintain dignity while being held hostage. Recent events have caused airline security experts all over the world to rethink traditional ideas on how to behave during a hijacking. Armed security agents typically wait to assess the nature of the opposition before they act. Travelers are advised not to get involved if they observe a disturbance or attack. Attempts to retake the aircraft also present extreme dangers to passengers and crew. If the hijacking leads to a drawn‐out situation where passengers are being held for a long period of time, try to remain as calm and clear‐headed as possible.","","9781119574392","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9898651.pdf&bkn=9898145&pdfType=chapter","","Terrorism;Guidelines;Aircraft;US Government;Planning;Buildings;Airports","","","","","","","","21 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It helps the readers learn how surveillance is performed to understand how to utilize countersurveillance techniques to detect whether the readers are being watched or followed and also learn the importance of not falling into predictable patterns of behavior. The chapter covers the topic of evacuation of personnel from high‐risk area. An emergency vehicle operations course program will teach the readers the basics of high‐speed driving. In most instances, the nature of an emergency will not necessitate the evacuation of corporate personnel from the country.","","9781119574392","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9898634.pdf&bkn=9898145&pdfType=chapter","","Automobiles;Roads;Inductors;Terrorism;Training;Planning;Weapons","","","","","","","","21 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Breaking into a Security Career in the Private Sector","D. A. Katz; I. Caspi",NA; NA,"Executive's Guide to Personal Security","","2020","","","205","215","A good many corporate security professionals are drawn from law enforcement, the military, and other government security agencies. There are a number of reasons to transition to the private sector, including the opportunity for higher compensation, better work‐life balance, greater flexibility, and the opportunity of trying something different. The private sector offers a broad range of opportunities, each with its own unique path. One of the biggest challenges when transitioning to the private sector is the need to adapt to the faster pace of business and a role with a greater accountability. A career transition requires effectively communicating how the readers' experiences transfer to their desired job using language that articulates well not only their past experience but the value it brings to their new role in a private company. A good place to start is by evaluating the readers' current and past responsibilities and identifying skills and competencies that are transferrable.","","9781119574392","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9898642.pdf&bkn=9898145&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Engineering profession;Law enforcement;Government;Remuneration;Leadership;Industries","","","","","","","","21 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Caspi",NA; NA,"Executive's Guide to Personal Security","","2020","","","169","184","This chapter provides executives and corporate security personal a general understanding of these threats and how to avoid them by adjusting behavior and maintaining the same level of vigilance executives employ to avoid harm. Espionage, commonly known as spying, dates back to prehistory. Every government in the world has an intelligence‐gathering apparatus. Intelligence may be obtained through the exploitation of technology and many other methods. A scam is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as “a dishonest scheme, a fraud”. Criminals, agents of foreign governments, and corporate competitors target business travelers because those travelers often have vital information. There are many types of elicitation techniques, and multiple techniques may be used in an elicitation attempt. The following are descriptions of some of the most common techniques elicitors: assumed knowledge, bracketing, response, confidential bait, criticism, deliberate false statements, flattery and mutual interest.","","9781119574392","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9898646.pdf&bkn=9898145&pdfType=chapter","","Fraud;Government;Business;Security;Companies;Sun;Economics","","","","","","","","21 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Developing a Security Mind‐set","D. A. Katz; I. Caspi",NA; NA,"Executive's Guide to Personal Security","","2020","","","1","13","This chapter focuses on development of a sense of vigilance in executives that becomes almost subconscious. The initial task is to learn to be more aware of executive's surroundings. Awareness training is generally the first thing taught in the survival and security courses given to government agents, military personnel, and police officers. This level of awareness is common in some civilian populations that are, tragically, the targets of terrorism. DEA instructors teach a color code awareness system borrowed directly from Colonel Jeff Cooper's excellent book <i>Principles of Personal Defense</i>. The term “tachypsychia” describes the perception of people under stress that the passage of time changes and everything is moving in slow motion. The term “tunnel vision” refers to the narrowing of executive's field of view as executive focus on a particular thing.","","9781119574392","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9898660.pdf&bkn=9898145&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Law enforcement;Automobiles;Urban areas;Psychology;Loading;Legged locomotion","","","","","","","","21 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

However, one FBG of the usual types cannot discriminate between temperature and strain. The new Fiber Random Gratings (FRG) present a large spectrum as opposite to the usual Bragg peak and the whole spectrum shifts varying the temperature or strain. By separating this large spectral band into smaller domains and by monitoring the response of each domain to temperature and strain, discriminating the temperature and strain contributions becomes feasible with a unique sensor. In this abstract, we study for the first time the radiation response of a type I FRG inscribed into a Ge-doped fiber with a fs-laser. Its thermal stability was checked by performing 3 cycles between $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with 2 hours lasting step of $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. This grating was irradiated at room temperature (RT) under X-rays, at a dose rate of 1 $\mathbf{Gy}(\mathbf{SiO}_{2})/\mathbf{s}$ up to the dose of 225 kGy. We observed a spectrum shift of approximatively 15 pm, independently of the spectral region, at the maximal dose, which represents an error of $\sim 1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ if the grating is used as a temperature sensor. The responses of several other RFBGs inscribed in different conditions will be added for the conference and final paper.","1609-0438","978-1-6654-1235-3","10.1109/RADECS50773.2020.9857691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857691","Fiber Bragg Grating;Fiber Random Grating;Optical Fiber Sensors;X-rays;Irradiation","Temperature sensors;Optical fiber sensors;X-rays;Fiber gratings;Gratings;Time factors;Thermal stability","Bragg gratings;fibre optic sensors;germanium;high-speed optical techniques;silicon compounds;strain sensors;temperature sensors;thermal stability;X-ray effects","spectral region;X-ray irradiation;thermal stability;fs-laser;spectral band;temperature sensor;dose rate;Ge-doped fiber;strain contributions;spectrum shift;Bragg peak;multiplexing ability;fiber Bragg gratings;fiber random gratings;radiation response;time 2.0 hour;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;temperature 20 degC to 60 degC;SiO2","","","","21","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If tolerant to SEEs, the power supply can also be potentially used as a current-controlled power supply for other applications in harsh radiation environments. In this context, board level testing is used to rapidly confirm the radiation hardness and expected performance designed into the power supply.

In this work, we measure and analyze the fault modes of NN-based object detection running on GPUs using a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam. Experimental results show that there are burst fault modes that repeat the same silent data corruption (SDC) errors and induce variant SDC errors. While the repetitive burst-mode errors of 56% probably originate from upsets in NN model parameters, the root cause of the remaining variant burst errors of 44% is unknown.","1609-0438","978-1-6654-1235-3","10.1109/RADECS50773.2020.9857684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857684","Soft error;GPU;burst error;neural network;object detection;silent data corruption;neutron","Radiation effects;Particle beams;Error analysis;Graphics processing units;Europe;Object detection;Artificial neural networks","electronic engineering computing;fault diagnosis;graphics processing units;neural nets;object detection;radiation hardening (electronics);reliability","GPU;quasimonoenergetic neutron beam;repetitive burst-mode errors;fault mode analysis;neutron irradiation testing;neural network-based object detection algorithms;graph processing units;NN-based object detection algorithms;SDC errors;silent data corruption errors","","","","8","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nature and origin of such current events was also investigated. The spatio-temporal resolution of laser and heavy ion microbeam was useful to locate the sensitive areas and to study the evolution of the current after the event triggering. These test methods also avoid any test artifact related to multiple impacts.

For higher fluences, the degradation of access transistors is identified as the main source for information loss. Without access transistor, single 1R devices were demonstrated to be functional even at the highest fluence of $10^{12}\text{ions}/\text{cm}^{2}$. TEM, EDX and nano diffraction analyses show no change in the HfO2 material, as well as in the repartition of the element in the layers, whatever the fluence.

In fact, the high energy electron fluxes are too low in Earth space environment to represent a real threat, from the SEE point of view, in currently used device technologies for space applications. Nevertheless, the increasing use of highly integrated CMOS technologies raises the question of the SEU electron sensitivity in the most recent technology nodes. Moreover, if the SEU sensitivity becomes significant in sub-28-nm devices, the system reliability may also be affected by the MBU risk. This work investigates about the electron induced SEU sensitivity of recent CMOS technologies. The related question of the MBU risk due to electrons in space environment is also studied. The devices exposed to electron beams are SRAM-based Xilinx FPGA manufactured in 20-nm planar and 16-nm FinFET technologies. Detailed 3D device circuit models were done with TRADCARE®. This tool was also used as interface to GEANT4 for forward Monte-Carlo simulations. An SRAM cell electrical layout was also implemented in TRADCARE to consider the electrical behaviour of the circuit.

This chapter provides a brief review of relevant survey methodology and investigates explicit anomalies and inconsistencies in published outputs of UK hotel chains 2016 survey. It examines the detrimental impact of use of highly variable sample sizes for deriving hotel chains’ customer scores. The chapter focuses on the customer score criterion, which, from correlation and factor analyses, appears to be a seriously compromised measure of “overall evaluation of the brand from a respondent perspective”. It looks into the non‐standard scoring adopted by the survey for weighting its ratings data, and shows how this markedly distorts resulting customer score comparisons. The chapter provides background on the range of biases affecting survey exercises and describes how these progressively detract from the validity and credibility of corresponding results and inferences.","","9781119721826","10.1002/9781119721871.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821660.pdf&bkn=9820902&pdfType=chapter","","Internet;Data analysis;IEEE Sections;Customer satisfaction;Business;Stars;Appraisal","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Modak","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India; Department of Dental Science, Nabadwip State General Hospital, Nabadwip, West Bengal, India","Intelligent Data Analysis: From Data Gathering to Data Comprehension","","2020","","","115","136","Dental caries is a painful bacterial disease of teeth caused by mainly Streptococcus mutants, acid, carbohydrates, and it destroys the enamel, dentine layer of the tooth. As per the World Health Organization report, worldwide, 60–90% of school children and almost 100% of adults have dental caries. Dental caries and periodontal disease for long days without treatment causes tooth loss. In the near future it will be an epidemic. It is a chronic disease that can affect us at any period of age. Recent research has indicated that there are possible links between oral infections and diabetes, heart, lung disease, stroke, and premature births. Dentists generally use radiographs to detect dental caries. Frequently taken x‐rays are harmful to the human body. There is not a single method to detect caries in its early stage. The size of carious lesions as well as early caries detection are very challenging tasks for the dental practitioners. The methods related to the dental caries detection are radiograph, QLF, ECM, FOTI, DIFOTI, etc. In radiograph‐based techniques, dentists analyze the image data. QLF stands for quantitative light‐induced fluorescence technique. In this method, caries are detected by analyzing the secondary emission data. Fluorescence is an incident by which an object is excited by a fixed wavelength and then emits light at higher wavelength (the secondary emission). In QLF system, the excitation wavelength is around 370 nm and a band‐pass filter is used after the transducer to separate the secondary emission data from other data. The quantitative assessment of the demineralization status of the tooth from secondary emission is used to detect caries lesions. ECM stands for electrical caries monitoring. In this method, the caries lesion is detected on the basis of some parameter, like temperature, ionic content of the dental tissue fluids, dentin tissues, hydration of the enamel, etc. These parameters are obtained by analyzing the data from electrical signals. FOTI carried detection method is an easy, fast, and inexpensive method of teeth imaging in the presence of multiple scattering. It is based on the changes in the light scattering and absorption of light photons. The quality of data is very important for the proper diagnosis of dental caries. Quality improvement is not restricted within the boundary of filtration. This could be extended by enhancing the resolution of data in an intelligent manner. Nowadays, x‐rays in periodic intervals is not the only solution to monitor the caries lesion growth; red, green, and blue (RGB)‐based image analysis could be used to some extend for caries lesion growth monitoring. Dental caries–related data analysis is essential in order to reduce the workload of dental practitioners, and scientists and engineers are working in this domain. This chapter describes the different techniques and current trades of dental caries detection methods from a data analysis perspective. Our findings in this review work include shortlisting the merits and negatives of the existing dental caries detection methods, identifying the loopholes of existing methods, outlining the findings of significant improvements needed for image processing–based techniques where the image quality is poor, and showcasing the results of a comparative study between existing methods with respect to the type of data.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822301.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Teeth;Dentistry;Radiography;Lesions;Diseases;X-ray imaging;Tomography","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Each step of the risk‐based approach entails comprehensive data collection and rigorous data analysis. Due to the complex nature of the rock slopes, the data and the associated analyses exhibit various uncertainties; these uncertainties tend to propagate from the initial steps to the last ones. Hence, a thorough uncertainty analysis in the process is essential. Usually the uncertainty analysis is performed during the hazard assessment, as geomechanical properties of a rock slope have the highest degree of uncertainty. The hazard assessment includes quantifying failure probability of a rock slope for a given period of time. The computation of failure probability necessitates assessing the structural reliability of the rock slope, which does not include a temporal component.","","9781119513940","10.1002/9781119513957.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822938.pdf&bkn=9820812&pdfType=chapter","","Rocks;Hazards;Uncertainty;Risk management;Reliability engineering;Kinematics;Data collection","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Common pitfalls that developers face when deploying cloud applications include whether the same functionality will be available on‐premises versus off‐premises, poor documentation and training, tenancy separation, and the use of secure and validated APIs are all significant challenges developers face in deploying applications in the cloud environment.","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823061.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Security;Training;Computer architecture;Application security;Software as a service;Testing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter focuses on network activity and explores the Elastic Stack and ways to integrate host‐based data to provide enhanced visibility across the network. It examines the architecture for deployment of Security Onion in an enterprise and each of the major tools integrated into the platform. The chapter outlines basic skills to facilitate effective incident response for those situations where the critical data that reader need has not been conveniently placed into Elastic Stack or another analysis platform. The Elastic Stack provides an amazing platform to support incident response, but readers occasionally will need to access other data sources directly on a host or that otherwise have not been ingested into a centralized analysis platform. Web servers, *nix systems, and other applications store many of their logs in a text‐based format.","","9781119560289","10.1002/9781119560302.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821988.pdf&bkn=9820823&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Sensors;Monitoring;Cryptography;Servers;Open source software;Network security","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Conclusion","G. Edwards",NA,"Cybercrime Investigators Handbook","","2020","","","273","275","From the cybercrime investigator's perspective locating the offender and holding them to account for their actions may be a very difficult and complex operation requiring a significant investment in time and resources, regardless of whether a law enforcement or civilian investigator is tasked to work the case. As technology develops, more evidence becomes available to criminal and civil investigators. Locating evidence is restricted only by the imagination of the investigator, as our increasingly interconnected world collects more and more data on our activities. The Internet of Things can make the cybercriminal's job easier, but it can also be used to investigators' advantage as they investigate offenses where they suspect the criminal physically has been at the crime scene. Incorporating this evidence into their investigation is a skill they will refine throughout their career, with positive results achieved, honest mistakes made, lessons learned, and a higher‐skilled investigator emerging.","","9781119596325","10.1002/9781119596318.ch19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822184.pdf&bkn=9820837&pdfType=chapter","","Computer crime;Law enforcement;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Java applications contain two types of data: primitive types and reference types. Java has eight built‐in data types, referred to as the Java primitive types. These eight data types represent the building blocks for Java objects, because all Java objects are just a complex collection of these primitive data types. That said, a primitive is not an object in Java nor does it represent an object. A primitive is just a single value in memory, such as a number or character. A reference type refers to an object (an instance of a class). Unlike primitive types that hold their values in the memory where the variable is allocated, references do not hold the value of the object they refer to. Instead, a reference “points” to an object by storing the memory address where the object is located, a concept referred to as a pointer. Unlike other languages, Java does not allow you to learn what the physical memory address is.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822340.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Codes;Writing;Encapsulation;Programming;Interviews;IEEE Sections","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It is important to note that compliance is not solely up to the CSP or the user of the CSP resources. CSPs can offer compliance certifications for their resources, but you as a consumer of those resources will have to show compliance as well if required.Data sovereignty is the concept that data is subject to laws and regulations of a particular nation. There is an important distinction to make here on data sovereignty that is often misunderstood. Often people assume that the data sovereignty laws of the nation where the data is stored are the laws that must be applied. However, that is not the case; the data sovereignty laws of the nation where data is located are to be applied.FIPS is a federal standard that details the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. Cryptographic modules are hardware devices (usually, but can be software) that are used to encrypt sensitive information.FERPA is often called the HIPAA of educational systems. It is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. There are in essence two parts of FERPA: first, that educational information will not be shared with any unauthorized individuals, and second, it guarantees access to educational information to authorized individuals. FERPA does not require or recognize audits or certifications.","","9781119642237","10.1002/9781119642138.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823154.pdf&bkn=9820852&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Regulation;Companies;Cloud computing;Servers;Certification;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The US Naval Research Laboratory created the concept of the dark web for the legitimate purpose of helping their people to communicate over the Internet using an increased form of security. The criminal community has identified the dark web as being of specific benefit to them, as this secure method of communicating while hiding their identity meant that they, too, could communicate covertly with less chance.

Due to the difficulty in interpreting their inner workings, some machine learning models are considered black box models. As one may expect from the name, in contrast to the black box models, white box models' inner workings are transparent.Both have their own advantages and limitations. When something goes wrong, as it inevitably does, it can be a daunting task discovering the behavior that caused an event while it is locked away inside a black box where discoverability is virtually impossible. On the other hand, if a white box model accomplishes some task successfully, it can be pinpointed exactly why it was able to complete the said task. Since white box models are usually very simple, they cannot accurately model complex problems that black box models can.So, white box and black box models are caught in an explainability‐accuracy trade‐off. However, with advances in intelligent data analysis (IDA), the explainability gap in black box models is reducing. As new techniques and algorithms are being developed, explainability is no longer a property of the model. Such techniques separate concerns of predictive power and explanation generation. Now, simple, human‐readable explanations can be generated for black box models, without assuming anything about the internal workings of the models. These techniques give us a way to explain why decisions were made by complex systems, even if that explanation is not an exact representation of what the model actually did.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822768.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Machine learning;Task analysis;Data visualization;Collaborative filtering;Web pages;Predictive models;Mathematical models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Easy Subnetting","T. Lammle",NA,"Understanding Cisco Networking Technologies, Volume 1: Exam 200-301","","2020","","","105","132","This chapter discusses how to subnet an IP network‐an indispensably crucial skill that's central to mastering networking in general. Creating subnetworks is essentially the act of taking bits from the host portion of the address and reserving them to define the subnet address instead. For the subnet addressing scheme to work, every machine on the network must know which part of the host address will be used as the subnet address. This condition is met by assigning a subnet mask to each machine. A subnet mask is a 32‐bit value that allows the device that's receiving IP packets to distinguish the network ID portion of the IP address from the host ID portion of the IP address. This 32‐bit subnet mask is composed of 1s and 0s, where the 1s represent the positions that refer to the network subnet addresses. Not all networks need subnets, and if not, it really means that they're using the default subnet mask, which is basically the same as saying that a network doesn't have a subnet address. Another term you need to familiarize yourself with is Classless Inter‐Domain Routing (CIDR). It's basically the method that Internet service providers (ISPs) use to allocate a number of addresses to a company, a home‐their customers.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821708.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","TCPIP;Routing;Wide area networks;Web and internet services;Videos;Turning;Nails","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Stateful firewall carries out the same function as a packet‐filteringfirewall and also keeps track of the state of network connections. Application firewall (proxy firewall) is usually a server that carries out a type of filtering of information located in layers 3, 4, 5 and 7. An access control list (ACL) is a sequential set of authorization or denial instructions that are applied to addresses or higher layer protocols. ACLs make it possible to control incoming or outgoing traffic in a network.","","9781119706748","10.1002/9781119706762.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821767.pdf&bkn=9820894&pdfType=chapter","","Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Access control;Standards;Information filters;Routing protocols;Monitoring","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Anderson",NA,"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems","","2020","","","865","906","In this chapter, the author describes four classes of application at the bleeding edge of security research. They are: autonomous and remotely‐piloted vehicles; machine learning, from adversarial learning to more general issues of artificial intelligence in society; privacy technologies; and finally, electronic elections. What these have in common is that while previously, security engineering was about managing complexity in technology with all its exploitable side‐effects, we are now bumping up against complexity in human society. A whistleblower needs to understand the hazards in order to devise sensible operational security procedures, but a typical newspaper doesn't discuss them the way that, for example, this chapter does. An election campaign is a long slog of fundraising with dozens of volunteers who're hard to discipline and whose focus is victory rather than security.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823021.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Automobiles;Roads;Vehicles;Drones;Autopilot;Privacy;Autonomous automobiles","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It will also provide an overview of the Microsoft Azure solution stack before examining various types of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and how Azure services can be procured. Organizations are looking to digitally transform and focus on creating only what helps differentiate themselves in the market through accelerated innovation. For organizations, this means more agility and the capability to elasticity scale potentially globally. Additionally, these drivers often mean getting out of the datacenter business in favor of cloud service utilization, which enables a greater focus on the application and optimized IT spend, all while dealing with new security implications. As organizations embrace cloud services, a complete rethinking is required, as the network can no longer be a trusted boundary since many services will live outside the corporate network.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821935.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Servers;Organizations;Virtualization;Hardware;Virtual machining;Operating systems","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Given the fact that interactive logons present such a high risk, this chapter looks at other mechanisms to access remote systems in a noninteractive manner to conduct remote triage. Windows Management Instrumentation offers a vast number of options for querying information on network resources. The chapter provides several examples of ways in which Windows Management Instrumentation Command‐line utility (WMIC) can be used to tap into this wealth of information. WMIC has provided administrators and incident responders with a powerful tool since the days of Windows XP. However, with PowerShell, incident responders have an even more powerful tool at their disposal. Incident handlers should know how to use both tools, since the remote access mechanisms employed by them differ, and firewall rules or other network defenses may limit access to a system to one option or the other.","","9781119560289","10.1002/9781119560302.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821965.pdf&bkn=9820823&pdfType=chapter","","Operating systems;Standards;Syntactics;Random access memory;Instruments;IEEE Sections;Simple object access protocol","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter intends to analyze the hypothesis about whether or not global green space variation is changing the global air quality. We performed a big data analysis with a data set that contains more than 1 M (1 048 000) green space and air quality data points by considering 190 countries during 1990–2015. Air quality is measured by considering particular matter (PM) value. The analysis is carried out using multivariate graphs and a K‐means clustering algorithm. The relative geographical changes of the tree areas, as well as the level of the air quality, were identified. Our analyzing shows that in the level of annual average PM value (10 μg m–3), which is considered as not polluted air quality level (PM2.5), the percentage of green space areas reached 84% in 2014. When the PM2.5 value goes above 70 μg m–3, it means extremely bad air quality and a high‐risk level, thus, green space area percentage is below 24%. Furthermore, when the annual PM value is between 36 and 69 μg m–3 (PM > 36 and PM < 69), it means that the air quality level is at risk, and green space area percentage values vary between 35% and 70%. We also found that the atmospheric air quality is proportional with green space area, but not in a 1 : 1 relation. Moreover, this study shows that there is a significant effect on atmospheric air quality with the global green space variation by considering PM. The study addresses the issue of poverty, along with deforestation to stop poverty‐induced human activities that lead to deforestation and to improve the atmospheric air quality that is useful as a reference for researchers supporting atmospheric studies to observe the effect of air quality and deforestation.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821684.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Green products;Forestry;Organizations;Meteorology;Air pollution;Statistics;Solids","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A business analyst (BA) working with cloud providers should understand common service and deployment models, cloud characteristics, and important design aspects such as redundancy, high availability, and disaster recovery. Cloud computing is a method by which you access remote servers that provide software, storage, database, networking, or compute services for you. Instead of your company needing to buy the hardware and software, another company does, and yours essentially rents it from them and accesses it over the Internet. There isn�t one cloud but hundreds ofcommercial clouds in existence today. Many of them are owned by big companies, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, HP, and Apple. The three most popular ones for businesses are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.There are many advantages to cloud computing, and the most important ones revolve around money. Cloud providers get economies of scale by having a big pool of resources available to share among many clients. It may be entirely possible for them to add more clients without needing to add new hardware, which results in greater profit. From a client company's standpoint, the company can pay for only the resources it needs without investing large amounts of capital into hardware and software that will be outdated in a few years. Using the cloud is often cheaper than the alternative.","","9781119642237","10.1002/9781119642138.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823221.pdf&bkn=9820852&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Hardware;Companies;Computational modeling;Business;Internet;Virtualization","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Origins and Concepts of Data Privacy","S. Sharma",MD MRCP,"Data Privacy and GDPR Handbook","","2020","","","1","21","The concept of privacy comes from a Western school of thought and had blossomed through common law, having its first roots in defenses against state action and privacy torts. This chapter illustrates the questions and challenges surrounding individual rights and privacy of personal data by exploring online dating and relationship‐seeking apps such as match.com, eHarmony, and OK Cupid. To search for compatible relationships through these apps, users create their profiles by voluntarily providing personal information, including their name, age, gender, and location, as well as other character traits such as religious beliefs, and sexual orientation. Lawmakers' challenge is that regulations for protecting individuals' data privacy should foster technology‐driven personal convenience and not stifle ethical commercial activities and interests. Notice‐and‐choice puts the bulk of the responsibility in the hands of the consumer of protecting their own privacy instead of powerful Data Collectors. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book.","","9781119594253","10.1002/9781119594307.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822341.pdf&bkn=9820836&pdfType=chapter","","Data privacy;Privacy;Mobile handsets;Surveillance;Social networking (online);General Data Protection Regulation;Vehicles","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Selecting Appropriate Storage Technologies","D. Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer Study Guide","","2020","","","1","28","This chapter describes how to select the appropriate storage technologies. Data engineers choose how to store data for many different situations. Sometimes data is written to a temporary staging area, where it stays only seconds or less before it is read by an application and deleted. In other cases, data engineers arrange long‐term archival storage for data that needs to be retained for years. Data engineers are increasingly called on to work with data that streams into storage constantly and in high volumes. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are an example of streaming data. Application data is generated by applications, including mobile apps, and pushed to backend services. This data includes user‐generated data, like a name and shipping address collected as part of a sales transaction. It also includes data generated by the application, such as log data. Event data, like clickstream data, is also a type of application‐generated data. The volume of this kind of data depends on the number of users of the application, the types of data the application generates, and the duration of time the application is in use. This size of application data that is sent in a single operation can vary widely.","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822821.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Business;Access control;Machine learning;Data models;Pipelines;Internet of Things","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Data is an asset. As with all other assets, knowing what data you have, where it is (logically and physically), and its relative value and need for protection is absolutely essential for properly apportioning security resources. The data owner is the organization that has collected or created the data, in general terms. Within the organization, we often assign a specific data owner as being the individual with rights and responsibilities for that data; this is usually the department head or business unit manager for the office that has created or collected a certain dataset. The data custodian is any person or entity that is tasked with the daily maintenance and administration of the data. The custodian also has the role of applying the proper security controls and processes as directed by the data owner. Within an organization, the custodian might be a database administrator. It is important to know the phases of the data lifecycle, in order, both for the CCSP exam and for your understanding of data security concepts. In this section of the chapter, we're mostly concerned with the first phase: Create. The data owner will be identified in the Create phase.

Some of their purpose is to serve as training systems. Designing the AR‐based training systems should consider the possible threats. This chapter discusses the effects of three threats on the effectiveness and efficiency of the industrial training. The high physical fidelity of these systems should be compared to the benefits of high cognitive fidelity. The ability to add virtual feedback to the real‐world task should be considered carefully, given that feedback can also inhibit deeper learning processes. Finally, enhancing the real‐world experience with more information channels has the potential of improving acquisition, but there is evidence that in some situations the additional information channels might interfere with essential processes such as active exploration and communication.","","9781119513940","10.1002/9781119513957.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822176.pdf&bkn=9820812&pdfType=chapter","","Training;Task analysis;Augmented reality;Performance evaluation;Maintenance engineering;Vibrations;Sports","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Because the cloud customer and provider will each be processing data that, at least in some part, belongs to the customer, they will share responsibilities and risks associated with that data. Simply put, these risks and responsibilities will be codified in the service contract between the parties. That contract, however, will be the result of a complex process of deliberation and negotiation. A private cloud is a distributed computing environment with only one customer (as opposed to the more common multitenant environment, typified by public cloud). A private cloud can be implemented by an organization (running its own data center, and supplying cloud services to its employees, vendors, and clientele), or it can be hosted by a provider. In some situations, the provider will own the hardware that contains the private cloud, hosted in the provider's data center. The customer will be granted exclusive access to that particular set of hardware, and no other customers will have their cloud hosted on those same devices. In some cases, the customer owns the hardware, which is hosted, physically inside the provider's data center (often referred to as a co‐lo, or colocation center).","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822048.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Security;Data centers;Contracts;Law;Government;Computational modeling","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Comparison between unfolding configurations and PCU solutions are carried out through Procrustes analysis. Projection pursuit includes many techniques for finding interesting projections of multivariate data in low‐dimensional projections. Projection pursuit clustering is a synthesis of projection pursuit and non‐hierarchical clustering methods which simultaneously attempts to cluster the data and to find a low‐dimensional representation of this cluster structure.

"Enterprise Blockchains","J. Holbrook",NA,"Architecting Enterprise Blockchain Solutions","","2020","","","29","68","This chapter covers the four most widely used enterprise blockchain platforms and distributed ledgers, namely Hyperledger, R3 Corda, Quorum, and Ethereum. Hyperledger Fabric was mainly developed by IBM. Fabric is intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with the modular architecture that enterprises require. R3 is an enterprise blockchain software firm developed by a broad ecosystem of more than 200 members and partners across multiple industries from both the private and public sectors. Quorum is an open source blockchain solution built by enhancing the existing Ethereum blockchain. Enterprise blockchains have different requirements than public blockchains such as Ethereum. Ethereum uses a virtual machine to deploy the blockchain services. The chapter also covers the technical merits including security, consensus, virtual machines, features, and functions that are critical to understanding the blockchain platform. The chapter discusses the architecture at a fundamental level so IT administrators can understand the blockchain network and services.","","9781119557685","10.1002/9781119557722.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821947.pdf&bkn=9820821&pdfType=chapter","","Blockchains;Distributed ledger;Fabrics;Protocols;Peer-to-peer computing;Organizations;Linux","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"What to Do Next","J. Savill",NA,"Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Services for Architects: Designing Cloud Solutions","","2020","","","399","413","This chapter focuses on overcoming both types of barriers and starting your journey towards learning the concept of Azure services. Most concerns related to the utilization of public cloud services, including Azure, relate to perceived security risks. For systems running in your own datacenter, you have full control. You can see the physical servers; you can see if someone enters the server room; you know the other administrators who have access; and you know all the various users of the infrastructure. Of all concerns organizations have related to the public cloud, the number‐one concern is security. The loss of control, compliance, and complexity are also big concerns. To a lesser degree, concerns such as maturity of technology, lack of expertise, and cost exist, but security is the big one. Every public cloud vendor knows this. Azure has its own specification for fabric elements such as compute and storage. However, commodity components, such as off‐the‐shelf processors rather than some Azure‐specific CPU, are used. This means that common CPU firmware is used. Azure also uses a common hypervisor, Hyper‐V, the same way other major public cloud operators do. (Amazon Web Services [AWS] uses Xen, and Google uses Kernel‐based Virtual Machine [KVM].) Common web components‐for example, IIS in Azure‐and common API support are used. If there is vulnerability in one of these, it exposes the risk in a huge way when in public cloud at the mega‐scale of Azure where the resources are shared between organizations.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822181.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Security;Internet;Virtual machine monitors;Servers;Government;Computer bugs","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Understanding Wide Area Networks","C. Panek",NA,"Networking Fundamentals","","2020","","","231","258","This chapter defines the most common WAN technologies available and increases your understanding of routing protocols and routing devices. Routing is the process of moving data across networks or internetworks between hosts or between routers themselves. Information is transmitted according to the IP networks and individual IP addresses of the hosts in question. A router is in charge of maintaining tables of information about other routers on the network or internetwork. It also utilizes several different TCP/IP protocols to transfer the data and to discover other routers. IP routing is the most common kind of routing as TCP/IP is the most common protocol suite. IP routing occurs on the Network layer of the OSI model. A static route is one that has been manually configured. A dynamic route is one that has been implemented dynamically with special routing protocols. In this section, you will configure RRAS statically and add the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) to allow for dynamic routing. A routing table is the data that is stored and used by TCP/IP network routers to determine the destination of messages that is being forwarded. The routing table is basically a database that is maintained and managed by the router's built‐in hardware and software. The routing tables contain a list of IP addresses.","","9781119650713","10.1002/9781119650768.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822811.pdf&bkn=9820864&pdfType=chapter","","Routing;Routing protocols;Protocols;Servers;Logic gates;Wide area networks;TCPIP","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

At the specific industrial company level, this chapter considers the competence and maturity for advanced manufacturing as a multidimensional latent construct that can be characterized along four dimensions: value chain, infrastructure, monitoring and control processes, and engineering processes. These dimensions, together, make up an individual‐level characteristic that can be understood as a single industrial organizational construct. Each of these four dimensions consist of subdimensions that were identified through an extensive process based on literature, consultation with experts, and reports by international entities working on promoting the implementation of advanced manufacturing.","","9781119513940","10.1002/9781119513957.ch21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822526.pdf&bkn=9820812&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Capability maturity model;Industries;Business;Three-dimensional printing;Process control","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Understanding Internet Protocol","C. Panek",NA,"Networking Fundamentals","","2020","","","103","146","This chapter discusses how to enable computers on the LAN or the Internet to communicate through Layer 3 IP addressing. Internet Protocol version 4 or IPv4 is the most frequently used communications protocol. IP resides on the Network layer of the OSI model, and IP addresses consist of four numbers, each between 0 and 255. The protocol suite is built into most operating systems and is used by most Internet connections in the United States and many other countries. As mentioned in Lesson 1, it is composed of a network portion and a host portion, which are defined by the subnet mask. For an IP address to function there must be a properly configured IP address and compatible subnet mask. To connect to the Internet, you also need a gateway address and DNS server address. Advanced examples of IP configurations include sub‐netting, NAT, and CIDR. To better understand IPv4 addresses, they have been categorized as five IP classes. Some have been reserved for private use, whereas the rest are utilized by public connections. This classification system helps to define what networks can be used on the LAN and what IP addresses can be used on the Internet. IPv4 addresses are further classified as either public or private. Public IP addresses are ones that are exposed to the Internet; any other computers on the Internet can potentially communicate with them. Private IP addresses are hidden from the Internet and any other networks. They are usually behind an IP proxy or firewall device.","","9781119650713","10.1002/9781119650768.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821608.pdf&bkn=9820864&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Internet;Protocols;TCPIP;Local area networks;Testing;Network architecture","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A VPN is implemented by using virtual network devices on the client and server. IKE is a method of exchanging security material so that a secure tunnel can be established. It is commonly used with IPsec, which actually encrypts the data. IPsec operates on the network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, adding authentication and encryption to the otherwise nonsecure Internet protocol. The chapter covers a few backend systems commonly used for VPN authentication, including SQL database, Remote Authentication Dial‐In User Service (RADIUS), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and pluggable authentication modules. Organizations use OpenVPN to employ a web interface to allow their customers or employees to connect easily. OpenVPN is also vulnerable to Shellshock.","","9781119561484","10.1002/9781119561507.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822558.pdf&bkn=9820824&pdfType=chapter","","Virtual private networks;Protocols;Internet;Servers;Authentication;Encryption;Companies","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

QoS is principally aimed at remedying problems of network congestion or saturation, which cause latencies and data loss. It also enables the optimal support of multimedia applications, which are based on the principle of real time. QoS is a key factor for managing multimedia applications and for the success of the Internet protocol as a basic unifying protocol for next‐generation convergent networks. High availability represents all of the methods and means that contribute to ensuring that an IT infrastructure always provides the planned functionalities and services. Redundancy, backup, data replication and load distribution help to ensure high availability of the IT system.

It also reviews how GCP services like Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Pub/Sub, and Cloud Composer are used to implement data pipelines. A data pipeline is an abstract concept that captures the idea that data flows from one stage of processing to another. Data pipelines are modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A graph is a set of nodes linked by edges. A directed graph has edges that flow from one node to another. Data pipelines may have multiple nodes in each stage. For example, a data warehouse that extracts data from three different sources would have three ingestion nodes. Not all pipelines have all stages. A pipeline may ingest audit log messages, transform them, and write them to a Cloud Storage file but not analyze them. It is possible that most of those log messages will never be viewed, but they must be stored in case they are needed. Log messages that are written to storage without any reformatting or other processing would not need a transformation stage. Transformation is the process of mapping data from the structure used in the source system to the structure used in the storage and analysis stages of the data pipeline.","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822102.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Pipelines;Cloud computing;Machine learning;Data models;Buildings;Transforms;Soft sensors","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter explores some factors which can force, from an architecture angle, alternative solutions to the “physical” data movement from data sources to data lakes. An interesting perspective to explore the data lake is the data gravity concept. The chapter investigates what the data gravity influence could be on the data lake design architecture and which are the parameters that could influence the data gravity concept. Like universal gravitation in physics, gravitation in information systems concerns two types of object, namely data and processes. The force can thus be exerted either between data, between processes, or between data and processes. By usage, operational systems are the principal data source for Decision support Information Systems.","","9781119720423","10.1002/9781119720430.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821702.pdf&bkn=9820901&pdfType=chapter","","Gravity;Big Data applications;Earth;Random access memory;Physics;Information systems;Space vehicles","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

For example, String and StringBuilder, along with their associated APIs, are used to create and manipulate text data. An array, List, Set, or Map are used to manage often large groups of data. Once a String object is created, it is not allowed to change. It cannot be made larger or smaller, and you cannot change one of the characters inside it. You can think of a String as a storage box you have perfectly full and whose sides can't bulge. There's no way to add objects, nor can you replace objects without disturbing the entire arrangement. The trade‐off for the optimal packing is zero flexibility. Mutable is another word for changeable. Immutable is the opposite‐an object that can't be changed once it's created.

"Managing a Cisco Internetwork","T. Lammle",NA,"Understanding Cisco Networking Technologies, Volume 1: Exam 200-301","","2020","","","193","216","This chapter discusses how to manage Cisco routers and switches on an internetwork. It also focuses on the main components of a router, as well as the router boot sequence. When a Cisco device boots up, it performs a series of steps, called the boot sequence, to test the hardware and load the necessary software. As part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, Telnet is a virtual terminal t protocol that allows you to make connections to remote devices, gather information, and run programs. After your routers and switches are configured, you can use the Telnet program to reconfigure and/or check up on them without using a console cable. You run the Telnet program by typing telnet from any command prompt (Windows or Cisco), but you need to have VTY passwords set on the IOS devices for this to work. Debug is a useful troubleshooting command that's available from the privileged exec mode of Cisco IOS. It's used to display information about various router operations and the related traffic generated or received by the router, plus any error messages.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822802.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Read only memory;Software;Servers;Flash memories;Hardware","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter focuses on those areas of digital forensics that are often applicable to incident response scenarios. It illustrates concepts and artifacts of interest to incident responders, not to teach the usage of any one tool. For illustrative purposes, it utilizes Magnet Forensics' Axiom in many of the screenshots since it presents a clear illustration of the artifacts being discussed. When analyzing a forensic image, commercial forensics tools provide a mechanism to access the volume shadow copy data. Volume shadow copies are of immense value in analyzing a forensic image but can also be used to improve triage efforts.","","9781119560289","10.1002/9781119560302.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823212.pdf&bkn=9820823&pdfType=chapter","","Forensics;Operating systems;Open source software;Metadata;Digital forensics;Workstations;Videos","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Wang",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Advances in Data Science: Symbolic, Complex, and Network Data","","2020","","","169","185","This chapter discusses the problem of attributed graph clustering when the vertices are described by real attributes. Community detection deals with the unsupervised clustering of graph vertices in social networks. Experiments on synthetic datasets aim at evaluating the performances of I‐Louvain, which exploits attributes and relational data on artificial networks. The chapter then introduces I‐Louvain, an algorithm that combines criterion with M.E.J. Newman's modularity to detect communities in attributed graphs. Indeed, there are some implementations of Louvain algorithm using the Spark framework. In I‐Louvain, the global modularity of a new partition can be quickly updated. One advantage of the Louvain method is the local optimization of the modularity done during the first phase. Indeed, the modularity gain can be computed using only local information concerning the move of the vertex from its community to that of its neighbors. The complexity in updating inertia‐based modularity can be several orders of magnitude larger than updating Newman modularity.","","9781119695103","10.1002/9781119695110.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822658.pdf&bkn=9820889&pdfType=chapter","","Soft sensors;Social networking (online);Image edge detection;Probabilistic logic;Partitioning algorithms;Deep learning;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

GCP provides a range of compute infrastructure options. The best choice for your data engineering needs may depend on several factors. Compute Engine is GCP's infrastructure‐as‐a‐service (IaaS) product. With Compute Engine, you have the greatest amount of control over your infrastructure relative to the other GCP compute services. Compute Engine provides virtual machine (VM) instances, and users have full access to the VM's operating system. Users can choose from a large number of operating systems that are available on GCP. Once an instance is created, users are free to install and configure additional software to meet their needs. Users also configure the machine type either by choosing a predefined machine type or by configuring a custom machine type. Machine types vary by the number of vCPUs and the amount of memory provided. Instances can be configured with more security features, such as Shielded VMs and accelerators, such as GPUs, which are often used with machine learning and other compute‐intensive applications.","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823171.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Engines;Cloud computing;Containers;Microservice architectures;Standards;Scalability;Reliability","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The CCSP is not a certification of basic computer skills or training; it is a professional certification for practitioners with some background in the field. (ISC)2 expects that those who want to earn this particular certification already have experience in the industry; have been employed in an InfoSec position in some professional capacity; and have a thorough understanding of many basic areas related to computers, security, business, risk, and networking. Many people taking the test already have other certifications that validate their knowledge and experience, such as the CISSP. A true evaluation and understanding of the business processes, assets, and requirements is essential. Failing to properly capture the full extent of the business needs could result in not having an asset or capability in the new environment after migration to the cloud. The BIA is an assessment of the priorities given to each asset and process within the organization. A proper analysis should consider the effect (impact) any harm or loss of each asset might mean to the organization overall.

In this chapter, the author takes the reader through the past thirty years of evolution of attack and defence. The banking community realised that commercial operating systems were likely to remain insufficient to protect PINs, particularly from bank insiders, and decided to use separate hardware to manage them. This led to the development of standalone cryptographic modules or hardware security modules (HSMs). The chapter provides a few comments about the evaluation of HSMs. Each of the product categories discussed in this chapter, from HSMs down through FPGAs to smartcards, has a wide range of offerings with wide variability in the quality of protection. The security engineer will therefore have to pay attention to the many failure modes of systems involving tamper‐resistant processors that are more or less independent of the price or technical tamper‐resistance of the device.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821725.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Resistance;Government;Servers;Printers;Software;Pins;PROM","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The institutions that offer open data are invited to produce/release the aggregated data in the form of symbolic objects. The chapter adapts clustering methods for second‐level units that were motivated by analysis of some open data sets.

The cybercriminal may be internal or external to the network, or a contractor. This chapter presents examples of cybercriminals' common motivators for their crimes. The list is not exhaustive, as the important point to understand is that the motivation for the attack will make sense to the criminal during the time of preparing for and committing the offense. An attacker may commit a criminal offense against a company after a perceived injustice against themselves. The attacker may be a current or former employee, a competitor, or an issue‐motivated group. The professional criminal's motivation is seeking personal financial advantage.

There may be only one key stakeholder at your company, or there may be more than 100, depending on the size and scope of your organization.The cloud has fundamentally changed the landscape of computer networking and how we use technology. That's a bold statement, but it's not an exaggeration. If you look back 10 or 20 years, companies that wanted a network had to buy hardware for the network, servers, and client machines as well as needed software packages. The internal or contracted support team had to install, test, and configure all of it. Any needed changes took time to test and implement. And of course, hardware and software became out of date, so companies would have to write off or depreciate their assets and buy new ones to stay with the times.

It also, however, deals almost exclusively with the logical means of implementing identity management and access control. These logical means will involve management making decisions that establish organizational and local policies and procedures. Access control is all about subjects and objects. Subjects can be anything that is requesting access to or attempting to access anything in a system, whether data, metadata, or another process, for whatever purpose. Subjects can be people, software processes, devices, or services being provided by other web‐based systems. Subjects are trying to do something to or with the object of their desire. Objects can be collections of information, or the processes, devices, or people who have that information and act as gatekeepers to it. This subject‐object relationship is fundamental to your understanding of access control. It is a one‐way relationship: objects do not “do anything” to a subject.

Data in the cloud should be perceived, in the general case, to have the same needs and properties as data in the legacy environment. The data lifecycle still has a purpose; only the implementation particulars will change. Data will still be created (Create phase)‐both in the cloud itself and by remote users. It will be stored, in both the short term (Store phase) and long term (Archive phase), in the cloud. It will be manipulated and modified (Use phase) in the production environment hosted in the cloud. It will be transmitted to other users and made available for collaboration (Share phase) within the cloud; this is one of the significant benefits offered by cloud computing. In addition, we will still have a need to remove data from the production environment and sanitize the media afterward (Destroy phase). Obviously, the particulars for performing these activities, and doing them in a secure fashion, will evolve to match any new environmental challenges. Data will most often be created by users accessing the cloud remotely. Depending on the use case, the data might be created locally by users at their remote workstation and then uploaded to the cloud or it might be created in the cloud data center via remote manipulation of the data residing there.","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822272.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Data security;Data centers;Personnel;Encryption;Virtual private networks;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

SpiderFoot is based on the concept of information chaining, meaning that one piece of collected data is used to automatically obtain the next piece of data in a recursive process until all possible open‐source intelligence (OSINT) for the target and related entities has been collected. Intrigue is the open‐source engine that powers Intrigue.io, a platform for attack surface discovery. The primary focus of Intrigue is to discover assets and “interesting things” about an organization from an external perspective. Within Intrigue, every bit of information (or intelligence) is classified as an entity. Recon‐NG is probably one of the most widely used OSINT/recon gathering tools. The Recon‐NG tool comes with many built‐in modules organized by category, each with their own capabilities.","","9781119540892","10.1002/9781119541004.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821580.pdf&bkn=9820814&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Viruses (medical);Computer hacking;Solids;Manuals;IEEE Sections;Feeds","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

They first transform the complex data into basic data and then propose the incremental calculation method based on this type of data. The incremental calculation framework can be implemented to many frequently used statistical models built on the covariance matrix. The authors propose two online covariance matrix decomposition methods for basic data. The first method, ICMD1, can provide precise decomposition results and compute efficiently when the data dimension is not high. And the second decomposition method, ICMD2, can adapt to the high‐dimensional case. The authors provide functional linear regression and compositional principal component analysis as examples to show the efficiency of the proposed framework and also present simulation results. The simulation results proved both the efficiency and the effectiveness of this framework.","","9781119695103","10.1002/9781119695110.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821588.pdf&bkn=9820889&pdfType=chapter","","Principal component analysis;Matrix decomposition;Covariance matrices;Linear regression;IEEE Sections;Computational modeling;Mathematical models","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Enterprises accumulate vast amounts of data, and one of the challenges that comes with that is keeping track of information about datasets. For example, there may be hundreds of Cloud Storage buckets and folders that contain thousands of files. The people responsible for managing data need to keep track of information such as the contents of the data files, the version of the schema if the data is structured, how the data in one file relates to data in other files, who has access to the data, and so on. Data Catalog is a GCP metadata service for data management. It is fully managed, so there are no servers to provision or configure. Its primary function is to provide a single, consolidated view of enterprise data. Metadata is collected automatically during ingest operations to BigQuery and Cloud Pub/Sub as well through APIs and third‐party tools. BigQuery metadata is collected on datasets, tables, and views.

Blockchain services can have a major impact on governance, risk, and compliance functions, which include the following key areas of the business: IT governance, corporate and IT audits, policy management and regulatory change management, enterprise risk management, and smart contracts. Historically, compliance requirements for enterprises focused both on common concerns, such as privacy, and on more specialized concerns, such as requirements for healthcare, credit cards, and government‐mandated requirements.

As handwriting involves the functioning of the brain and motor control, it is affected. Alteration in handwriting is one of the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The handwriting gets shaky, due to loss of muscle control, confusion, and forgetfulness. The symptoms get progressively worse. The handwriting becomes illegible and phonological spelling mistakes become inevitable. In this study we are using the process of extracting features, which is to be used as a parameter for diagnosis. Deep learning technology is chosen as the technical tool to identify and classify common features of handwriting of patients with AD. Variational auto encoder (VAE), a deep unsupervised learning technique, has been applied, which is used to compress the input data and then to reconstruct it keeping the targeted output the same as the input. This study is aimed at successfully extracting distinguishable characteristics in the handwritten samples with the help of image segmentation and VAE reconstruction, which can be used as a diagnostic tool for early detection of AD.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822945.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Diseases;Neurons;Task analysis;Spinal cord;Alzheimer's disease;Visualization;Viruses (medical)","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter data set consists of 17 attributes and 998 193 collisions in New York City. The data is extracted from the New York Police Department (NYPD). Then the data set has been tested in three classification algorithms, which are k‐nearest neighbor (kNN), random forest, and Naive Bayes. The outputs are captured using k‐fold cross‐validation method. These outputs are used to identify and compare classifier accuracy, and random forest node accuracy and processing time. Further, an analysis of raw data is performed describing the four different vehicle groups to detect significance within the recorded period. Finally, extreme cases of collision severity are identified by using outlier analysis. The analysis demonstrates that out of three classifiers, random forest has been classified to show the highest number of accuracies with 95.03%, followed by kNN with 94.93%, and Naive Bayes provided the least accuracy of 70.13%, although it has recorded the least processing time of 5.7938 seconds. Further, random forest confirmed stable high accuracy throughout each node used. Therefore, random forest classifier can be identified as the most accurate prediction method among all other tested classification methods. Additionally, statistical analysis shows each described vehicle group to be highly related to the recorded period of years (p < 0.001). Overall, this chapter has identified a highly accurate classification model and the significance of a vehicle group that could minimize road risks and motor vehicle collisions.

The speeches of journalists or editors interviewed at Radio Canada, and previously at RFI, therefore, reveal some similarities as well as dissonances concerning their representations of their profession and practices in the digital age. In addition to a quantitative, statistical vision of the audience – always useful to the media for performance indicators measured in the form of cumulative audiences, trust indices or satisfaction – there is also an approach that characterizes the digital age of the media: personalizing the relationship with viewers. The media contract would be redefined within the framework of a renewed public space, in the sense that the co‐production of content and knowledge by journalists and the public would then make it possible to consider giving substance to a communicative action that can flourish in deliberation and enlightened citizen action.","","9781119694823","10.1002/9781119694885.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822294.pdf&bkn=9820887&pdfType=chapter","","Media;Interviews;Social networking (online);Internet;Journalism;Information age;TV","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It also discusses the various practices cloud data center operators should use to optimize performance and enhance durability of their infrastructure and systems. This will include coverage of systems monitoring, the configuration and change management program and BC/DR from a vendor perspective. It's important for data center operators to know how their hardware, software, and network are being utilized and what demand is being placed on all the relevant resources. This information helps data center operators know how to better apportion and allocate all those items in order to fulfill customer needs (and maintain compliance with SLAs). Data center operators, like anyone who owns an IT network, need to develop and maintain a realistic concept of what assets they control, the state of those assets, and explicit information about each asset. This goes beyond (but includes) the asset inventory‐the hardware, software, and media they own. It also includes documented records of configuration for all these elements, including versioning, deviations, exceptions, and the rationale for each, as well as a formal process for determining how, when, and why modifications need to be made.","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821673.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Data centers;Cloud computing;Maintenance engineering;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Performance evaluation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

There are multiple dimensions to achieving the right levels of availability and resiliency, which will be explored in this chapter. There are many aspects to availability and it's important to understand how the aspects fit together to architect the right solution for your organization. Backups often enable us to recover from some kind of human act, such as a deletion of data, corruption, or even attack. This is different from disaster recovery, which is often required in the event of an “act of god,” such as a flood or earthquake. It's important that backup data is stored both close to the source, for optimal restoration, but also far from the source, so that an event at the primary location does not impact both the source and only copy of the backup data. This is achieved by replication of the backup stores. Backup data needs to be as protected as the source data in terms of people that can access the data and encryption. In an ideal world, we hope to never have to use backups, but it's critical they be routinely tested to ensure they could be restored if needed.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823014.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Databases;Resilience;Maintenance engineering;Costs;Servers;Drives;Viruses (medical)","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Lammle",NA,"Understanding Cisco Networking Technologies, Volume 1: Exam 200-301","","2020","","","63","104","This chapter describes how to create a solid TCP/IP network with Cisco routers and switches. TCP first came on the scene way back in 1973, and in 1978, it was divided into two distinct protocols: TCP and IP. Later, in 1983, TCP/IP replaced the Network Control Protocol (NCP) and was authorized as the official means of data transport for anything connecting to ARPAnet, the Internet's ancestor. The DoD's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) created this ancient network way back in 1957 as a cold war reaction to the Soviet's launching of Sputnik. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) assigns IP addresses to hosts. It allows for easier administration and works well in small to very large network environments. Many types of hardware can be used as a DHCP server, including a Cisco router. DHCP differs from BootP in that BootP assigns an IP address to a host but the host's hardware address must be entered manually in a BootP table. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) takes large blocks of information from an application and breaks them into segments. It numbers and sequences each segment so that the destination's TCP stack can put the segments back into the order the application intended. After these segments are sent on the transmitting host, TCP waits for an acknowledgment of the receiving end's TCP virtual circuit session, retransmitting any segments that aren't acknowledged.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822234.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","TCPIP;Protocols;US Department of Defense;Open systems;Internet;Data models;Software","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Data protection laws prohibit the use of false or outdated personal data in the interest of the individuals concerned. While cyber threats such as hacking, cyber‐attacks and the darknet can only be researched with specific approaches that take into account the opacity of these phenomena, legal and public policy research perspectives look at the reactions to cyber threats.

Medical databases develop a huge bulk of knowledge and data, which mandates that a specialized tool is required to store and perform analysis of data and to effectively use saved knowledge and data. Information is extracted from data by using domain background knowledge in the process of intelligent data analysis (IDA). Various matters are dealt with in regard to the use, definition, and impact of these processes and how they are tested for their optimization in application domains of medicine. The primary focus of the chapter is on the methods and tools of IDA, with an aim to minimize the growing differences between data comprehension and data gathering. This chapter dives deep into the background of research that culminated in the evolution of existing IDA methods and considers the demand for intelligent medical data analysis, and also recommends a categorization of IDA methods. The chapter focuses on IDA methods and temporal abstraction methods and its relevancy in medicine. Methods and diagnostic domains have been suggested and the efficiency and relevance of approaches have been addressed. The chapter ends with the appraisal of selected IDA methods and how they can be applied in various medical applications.The crux behind the chapter is to focus on the understanding of different data analysis techniques, concepts, and the study of various classification methods of IDA, and will also ascertain major obstacles with regard to IDA in medical science.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822525.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Data mining;Medical services;Data visualization;Data analysis;Knowledge engineering;Guidelines;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It reviews internal networks, where people may have disparate hosts connected and needing to communicate with each other. The job of network‐attached storage (NAS), or a file server, is to store files and serve them to employees or members of an organization upon request. This seemingly simple task can be carried out by a number of different protocols and implemented in various ways, all with their own interesting flaws. File permissions dictate which users on a system, or network, can access any given file and the level of control they have over that file. The chapter examines NAS hacking toolkit and looks at what the Nmap scan results for a particularly vulnerable file server might look like—one that is running a range of different file sharing services.","","9781119561484","10.1002/9781119561507.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822585.pdf&bkn=9820824&pdfType=chapter","","File systems;Linux;File servers;Videos;Switches;Computer hacking;Computer crime","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Ethernet is a contention‐based media access method that allows all hosts on a network to share the same link's bandwidth. Some reasons it's so popular are that Ethernet is pretty simple to implement and it makes troubleshooting fairly straightforward as well. Ethernet is also readily scalable, meaning that it eases the process of integrating new technologies into an existing network infrastructure, like upgrading from Fast Ethernet to Gigabit Ethernet. Ethernet uses both Data Link and Physical layer specifications, so you'll be presented with information relative to both layers, which you'll need to effectively, implement, troubleshoot, and maintain an Ethernet network. Ethernet networking uses a protocol called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD), which helps devices share the bandwidth evenly while preventing two devices from transmitting simultaneously on the same network medium. CSMA/CD was actually created to overcome the problem of the collisions that occur when packets are transmitted from different nodes at the same time.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821783.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","Ethernet;Switches;Bandwidth;Media Access Protocol;Media;Data encapsulation;Collision avoidance","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It focuses on large‐scale network compromise. The first step in the incident investigation process is to gather initial information about a reported incident and establish objectives for the investigation. The chapter discusses general data acquisition and preservation considerations and best practices for small‐ and large‐scale incidents. During enterprise incident response, organizations typically employ a lifecycle approach to analyze incidents. This approach is particularly applicable to large‐scale investigations. The chapter provides information on various aspects of digital forensics that organizations need to consider when building incident response capabilities. It discusses the cyber threat intelligence lifecycle, with a particular emphasis on tactical intelligence to support incident response investigations, as well as common malware types and malware analysis techniques that analysts leverage as part of the incident response lifecycle.","","9781119679356","10.1002/9781119679349.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821874.pdf&bkn=9820878&pdfType=chapter","","Stakeholders;Data acquisition;Personnel;Organizations;Protocols;Cyberattack;Regulators","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) is the kernel of Cisco routers as well as all current Catalyst switches. In case you didn't know, a kernel is the elemental, indispensable part of an operating system that allocates resources and manages tasks like low‐level hardware interfaces and security. The Cisco IOS is a proprietary kernel that provides routing, switching, internetworking, and telecommunications features. The first IOS was written by William Yeager in 1985 and enabled networked applications. When you first bring up a Cisco IOS device, it will run a power‐on self‐test‐a POST. Upon passing that, the machine will look for and then load the Cisco IOS from flash memory if an IOS file is present, then expand it into RAM. As you probably know, flash memory is electronically erasable programmable read‐only memory‐an EEPROM. The next step is for the IOS to locate and load a valid configuration known as the startup‐config that will be stored in nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM). Once the IOS is loaded and up and running, the startup‐config will be copied from NVRAM into RAM and from then on referred to as the running‐config.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822186.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","Ports (computers);Random access memory;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Nonvolatile memory;Modems;Security","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Such policies are increasingly also known as information flow control. Systems that enforce a security policy independently of user actions are described as having mandatory access control (MAC), as opposed to the discretionary access control in systems like Unix where users can take their own access decisions about their files. Integrity‐only approach to MAC does mean that malware running at Low can steal all the data; so some users might care to set ‘NoReadUp’ for sensitive directories.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823218.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Safety;Government;Operating systems;Access control;Costs;Companies","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Copyright and DRM","R. Anderson",NA,"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems","","2020","","","815","863","Copyright has been among the highly contentious issues of the digital age, and drove the development of digital rights management. The basic problem is that a PC, being a general‐purpose computer, can in principle copy any file and send it to any other computer; unlike with analog copying, copies are perfect, so millions of copies might be made from one original. Hollywood's interest in finding new mechanisms for protecting copyright came together in the mid‐1990s with the military's interest in unobtrusive communications and public concerns over government efforts to control cryptography, and started to drive rapid developments in the field of information hiding. There was a vigorous policy debate in the 1990s and 2000s between the tech industry and many of the owners of ‘intellectual property’ – copyright, patents and trademarks – as the opening up of the Internet made copying easy and threatened traditional music, book and film publishers.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822577.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Software;Copyright protection;Licenses;Hardware;Companies;Servers;Microcomputers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

For many organizations, cloud computing is a new approach to delivering information services. These organizations may have built large, complex infrastructures running a wide array of applications using on‐premises data centers. Now those same organizations want to realize the advantages of cloud computing. They can start by building new systems in the cloud. That will bring some benefits, but there are likely further advantages to migrating existing applications from on‐premises data centers to the cloud. Cloud migrations are inherently about incrementally changing existing infrastructure in order to use cloud services to deliver information services. During migrations, some applications will move to the cloud, but those migrated applications may be integrated with other applications still running on‐premises. Before migrating data, you should understand any regulations that cover that data. For example, in the United States, the privacy of personal healthcare data is governed by HIPAA regulations, while in the European Union, the GDPR restricts where data on EU citizens may be stored. Businesses and organizations may have their own data classifications and data governance policies. These should be investigated, and if they exist, considered when planning data migrations.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821724.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Planning;Databases;Switches;Organizations;Monitoring;Soft sensors","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

They enable businesses to differentiate themselves from competitors and compete efficiently and effectively to the best of their abilities. At present, information technology, telecommunications, and manufacturing are merging as the means of production are becoming increasingly autonomous. Advanced manufacturing, or Industry 4.0, is based on three interconnected pillars: (i) Computerized Product Design and Smart Technology; (ii) Smart Sensors, Internet of Things, and Data Collectors integrated in Manufacturing Lines; and (iii) Analytics, Control Theory and Data Science.This chapter consists of a critical review of the third pillar of data analytics, and how it is related to the two other pillars. Our objective is to present a context for a range of analytic challenges in the Industry 4.0 context. We first provide a general introduction to advanced manufacturing elements followed by a listing of trends in modern analytic tools and technology. We then list challenges in analytics supporting Industry 4.0. The information quality (InfoQ) framework serves here as a backbone for evaluating the analytics technology required for Industry 4.0. The eight InfoQ dimensions are: (i) Data Resolution; (ii) Data Structure; (iii) Data Integration; (iv) Temporal Relevance; (v) Chronology of Data and Goal; (vi) Generalizability; (vii) Operationalization; and (viii) Communication. These dimensions provide a classification of advanced manufacturing analytics domains and assist to identify gaps and new opportunities. The review provides a theoretical framework and suggestions for future research directions and implementations of analytics in Industry 4.0. It is designed to motivate researchers, practitioners, and industrialists and to facilitate Industry 4.0 deployments and expansions.","","9781119513940","10.1002/9781119513957.ch13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822350.pdf&bkn=9820812&pdfType=chapter","","Manufacturing;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Machine learning;Data models;Analytical models;Software;Context modeling","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Understanding Local Area Networking","C. Panek",NA,"Networking Fundamentals","","2020","","","1","42","This chapter explains the concept of local area network (LAN). A local area network (LAN) is a group of these computers that are confined to a small geographic area, usually one building. Setting up a LAN requires computers with network adapters, central connecting devices to connect those computers together, and a numbering scheme (such as IP addresses) to differentiate one computer from the next. It can also include servers, some type of protective device such as a firewall, and connections to perimeter networks that are adjacent to the LAN. As mentioned, a LAN requires computers with network adapters, central connecting devices, and some type of medium to tie it altogether, be it cabled or wireless connections. These must be connected together in some way to facilitate the transfer of data. It is important to define how they are connected together, as well as how they actually transmit data. Generally, when data is transferred on the LAN, it is sent in a serial fashion over twisted‐pair cabling. Serial data transfer means the transfer of one bit at a time‐a single bit stream. This is usually the format in which information is sent from one network adapter to another.","","9781119650713","10.1002/9781119650768.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822487.pdf&bkn=9820864&pdfType=chapter","","Local area networks;Servers;Documentation;Data transfer;Network topology;Topology;IP networks","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Security operations and administration entail a wide breadth of tasks and functions, and the security professional is expected to have a working familiarity with each of them. This can include maintaining a secure environment for business functions and the physical security of a campus and, specifically, the data center. Throughout your career, you will likely have to oversee and participate in incident response activities, which will include conducting investigations, handling material that may be used as evidence in criminal prosecution and/or civil suits, and performing forensic analysis. The Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) should also be familiar with common tools for mitigating, detecting, and responding to threats and attacks; this includes knowledge of the importance and use of event logging as a means to enhance security efforts. Another facet the security practitioner may have to manage could be how the organization deals with emergencies, including disaster recovery. There is a common thread running through all aspects of this topic: supporting business functions by incorporating security policy and practices with normal daily activities.

At its core, proper Java class design is about code reusability, increased functionality, and standardization. For example, by creating a new class that extends an existing class, you may gain access to a slew of inherited primitives, objects, and methods, which increases code reuse. Through polymorphism, you may also gain access to a dynamic hierarchy that supports replacing method implementations in subclasses at runtime. This chapter is the culmination of some of the most important topics in Java including class design, constructor overloading and inheritance, order of initialization, overriding/ hiding methods, and polymorphism. When creating a new class in Java, you can define the class as inheriting from an existing class. Inheritance is the process by which a subclass automatically includes any public or protected members of the class, including primitives, objects, or methods, defined in the parent class. For illustrative purposes, we refer to any class that inherits from another class as a subclass or child class, as it is considered a descendant of that class. Alternatively, we refer to the class that the child inherits from as the superclass or parent class, as it is considered an ancestor of the class.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822923.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Codes;Syntactics;Dogs;Standardization;Runtime;Encapsulation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

American Charles Bennett and Canadian Gilles Brassard are considered two of the fathers of quantum cryptography. Quantum‐based RNGs (QRNGs) are created in various ways and use different quantum materials and mechanisms to generate truly random numbers. All quantum devices using entanglement, including QRNGs, should always be tested to make sure they pass Bell's tests. Quantum‐based hashes can take either traditional binary inputs or quantum inputs and return a hash based on quantum states. A quantum‐based digital signature requires a quantum hash, a quantum‐based asymmetric key pair, and a quantum‐based digital signature algorithm, all represented by quantum properties. Just like in the traditional binary world, quantum encryption ciphers can be symmetric or asymmetric. In theory, quantum key distribution systems are resistant to eavesdropping because of the quantum physics observer effect and no‐cloning theorems.","","9781119618218","10.1002/9781119618232.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823104.pdf&bkn=9820848&pdfType=chapter","","Cryptography;Computers;Clocks;Quantum cryptography;Computer bugs;Quantum computing;Operating systems","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The sharing economy embodies a new socio‐economic system based on the exchange of goods and services between individuals. Among the theories that have been mobilized to explain the purpose of the sharing economy, is the service economy. Like any economic model, the sharing economy draws on basic elements to build its theory, through the formalization of the economic phenomenon and hypotheses, so as to identify its functioning and the scope of its model.","","9781119695028","10.1002/9781119695035.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822695.pdf&bkn=9820888&pdfType=chapter","","Sharing economy;Collaboration;Production;Business;Big Data;Urban areas;Transportation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This begins with understanding these four compute services: compute Engine; App engine; Kubernetes Engine and cloud functions. Each of these four services serves different use cases, although there are use cases that would benefit from using two or more of these services. Knowing how to choose among these is an important skill for architects to develop. Compute Engine is Google's infrastructure‐as‐a‐service (IaaS) offering. It is also the building block for other services that run on top of this compute resource. The core functionality provided by Compute Engine is virtual machines. Virtual machines (VMs) in Google Cloud Platform are also known as instances. Instances are provisioned by specifying machine types, which are differentiated by the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance. Machine types that have balanced CPU and memory are known as standard instances. There are also highmem and highcpu types, which have more memory and CPUs, respectively, than standard machine types. Google has recently added ultramem and megamem memory‐optimized types as well. Users can also specify customized machine types by specifying vCPUs, memory, CPU platform, number of GPUs, and GPU platform.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821600.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Engines;Cloud computing;Standards;Virtual machining;Containers;Servers;Monitoring","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The primary solution that blockchain technologies really provide as compared to a traditional database is around the distribution of trust. The nodes in the blockchain network in permissionless (enterprise) blockchains have a copy of the whole blockchain. The principles of blockchain have renewed trust in users in an era of digital economics and intrinsically fair social systems. For enterprises, the blockchain disruption will take place because it provides capabilities around compliance, cost efficiencies, or even transparent transactions for the customer base.

"Defining Networks with the OSI Model","C. Panek",NA,"Networking Fundamentals","","2020","","","43","73","This chapter defines each of the Open Systems Interconnection reference model (OSI model) layers using hands‐on labs and theory. The OSI model is a reference model used to define how data communications occur on computer networks. It is divided into layers that provide services to the layers above and below. These layers are associated with protocols and devices. The OSI model was created and ratified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and is represented in the United States by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The OSI model was created as a set of seven layers, or levels, each of which houses different protocols within one of several protocol suites, the most common of which is TCP/IP. The OSI model categorizes how TCP/IP transactions occur. It is invaluable when it comes to installing, configuring, maintaining, and, especially, troubleshooting networks. Sometimes, a protocol suite such as TCP/IP is referred to as a protocol stack. The OSI model shows how a protocol stack works on different levels of transmission (that is, how it stacks up against the model). Because it is the most tangible, let's start with the Physical layer. Later, when you view the model, it will be from the seventh layer on top to the first layer on bottom. As mentioned previously, a LAN requires computers with network adapters. These must be connected in some way to facilitate the transfer of data.","","9781119650713","10.1002/9781119650768.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823217.pdf&bkn=9820864&pdfType=chapter","","Protocols;Computational modeling;Data models;Physical layer;TCPIP;Measurement units;Internet","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Responsibilities in the Cloud","B. Malisow",NA,"(ISC)2 CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide","","2020","","","123","148","This chapter covers some of the contractual elements and technologies that make the relationship work, particularly application programming interfaces (APIs). Contracted cloud computing is unlike other operational modes and also unlike other managed IT service arrangements. In the case of cloud computing, the data owner ostensibly owns the information being stored and processed but does not have control over how it is stored and processed or who specifically handles the information (in terms of administration). Perhaps most intriguing of all, the data owner does not actually have physical access to the places and devices where that information is. The customer has all the responsibility and liability for protecting the information according to legal standards and regulation but often cannot mandate the actual protections and security measures in order to accomplish this. This leads to a very complex situation with a number of unique considerations. Some element of adversarial relationship exists between the cloud customer and cloud vendor because they have somewhat different goals. The cloud customer wants to maximize their computing capabilities and security of information while minimizing their costs. The cloud vendor wants to maximize its profits while minimizing what it has to provide (which is expressed in terms of computing capabilities and security of information). The primary intent for the cloud customer should be to meet business requirements. This could involve increasing efficiency, meeting regulatory needs, and ensuring durability of capabilities during contingencies, but it should always involve reducing cost.","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822905.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Security;Business;Data centers;Operating systems;Investment;Contracts","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Engaging cloud vendors","Q. Docter; C. Fuchs",NA; NA,"CompTIA Cloud Essentials+ Study Guide: Exam CLO-002","","2020","","","127","162","This chapter focuses on the financial aspects of engaging a cloud provider, business aspects of vendor relations, and cloud migration approaches.For most companies, the entire point of moving IT infrastructure to the cloud is to save money. Generally speaking, using the cloud versus having on‐premises infrastructure does do that. One way companies save money is by investing less in hardware and software that will become obsolete. Companies might also be able to save on taxes based on the types of expenditures they have. Choosing the right software licensing model can save money too, as can spending less on human capital and properly utilizing professional services. While using cloud services might be cheaper than the alternatives, it's unfortunately still not free. When thinking of moving to the cloud, you need to be aware of different classifications of expenditures and costs. Money spent on buying, improving, or maintaining fixed assets is classified as a capital expenditure. The cool finance kids will shorten this to CapEx.The other type of expenditure, called an operating expenditure (or OpEx), is used for the purpose of supporting the ongoing costs of conducting regular day‐to‐day business. Salaries, administrative expenses, office supplies, utilities, research and development, property taxes and insurance, licensing fees, and the cost of goods sold all fit into OpEx. The business benefits of OpEx are expected to be realized in the current year, and the goods or services purchased are not considered company assets for accounting or tax purposes.","","9781119642237","10.1002/9781119642138.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822860.pdf&bkn=9820852&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Finance;Costs;Business;Buildings;Licenses;Hardware","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter discusses how the elements for adequacy are subjective and may lead to some foreign nations being unable to deal with the European Union (EU) when it comes to data processing. Processing under GDPR requires a legal basis under the regulation. GDPR is centralized around reducing data harvesting by sanctioning specific types of international data transfers along with ensuring compliance within the EU. GDPR facilitates data exchanges in intragroup processing to a limited extent, requiring entities to be more diligent in their compliance efforts. On the one hand GDPR mandates cooperation between nations, but on the other they restrict the applicability of foreign law and judicial orders if it does not fit the scheme of the regulation.","","9781119594253","10.1002/9781119594307.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823306.pdf&bkn=9820836&pdfType=chapter","","Process control;Law;Companies;Data collection;Privacy;Regulation;Data privacy","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Business intelligence is becoming a major component of corporate strategy and is based on information that is the foundation of any decision‐making process. Economic intelligence is defined by ethical means, and its strength lies in the ability to interpret and not in the seditious nature of the information gathered. It allows the analysis of the information obtained and prospective thinking to anticipate changes and make decisions in accordance with the economic environment. Information is at the heart of business intelligence and its strategic management has become one of the key drivers of overall business performance. The stakes in the era of the “data revolution” are focused on the integration and enhancement of data.

The value of open source material is that it is freely available so that obtaining it rarely requires a search warrant. The most commonly searched open source sites are social media sites, such as Facebook, where many a criminal with an open profile has been caught bragging about their crimes or leaving behind evidence of their associates. While some criminals are very protective of their social media profile, others are very careless, and the evidence they leave open to investigators has been used in court by the prosecution. The chapter presents examples of the forms of open source material available to an investigator and discusses their benefits.

Java operators allow you to create a lot of complex expressions, but they're limited in the manner in which they can control program flow. Imagine you want a method to be executed only under certain conditions that cannot be evaluated until runtime. “Java Building Blocks,” a Java statement is a complete unit of execution in Java, terminated with a semicolon (;). Control flow statements break up the flow of execution by using decision‐making, looping, and branching, allowing the application to selectively execute particular segments of code. These statements can be applied to single expressions as well as a block of Java code. A basic for loop has the same conditional Boolean expression and statement, or block of statements, as the while loops, as well as two new sections: an initialization block and an update statement. A nested loop is a loop that contains another loop including while, do /while, for, and for‐each loops. For example, consider the following code that iterates over a two dimensional array, which is an array that contains other arrays as its members.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821556.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Decision making;Codes;Software;Switches;Runtime;Periodic structures","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Networking is typically broken into four key pillars: Connectivity, protection, delivery and monitoring. When thinking about connectivity, there are two major elements: something to place resources on (i.e., a network) and how to enable communication to that network. Much like a network in a physical location, a virtual network is utilized in Azure as a means to group and provide connectivity between services connected to the network. Virtual networks are broken up into one or more virtual subnets to which the resources are actually connected. A virtual network is bound by both subscription and region and cannot cross those boundaries‐i.e., a single virtual network cannot span regions or subscriptions. If you have multiple subscriptions using multiple regions, you must have a virtual network per region, per subscription. The IP space chosen for the virtual network should not overlap any IP space used on premises or in any other service used by your organization.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822786.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Virtual machining;Logic gates;Standards;Cloud computing;Protocols;Organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Cloud networking and storage","Q. Docter; C. Fuchs",NA; NA,"CompTIA Cloud Essentials+ Study Guide: Exam CLO-002","","2020","","","35","76","This chapter discusses how to identify cloud networking concepts and cloud storage technologies. Before the Internet was popular, cloud technology foundered in the periphery of computing technology. This is despite the core cloud technology‐virtualization‐having been in existence for nearly three decades. While cloud concepts were interesting, there was no practical way to implement them and realize their benefits. The Internet provided the needed environment for cloud usage; as the Internet grew, so too did the number of users who could benefit from cloud services. Clearly, the Internet enabled the cloud. While this relationship is a positive, there's a flip side as well. Not only is the cloud Internet‐enabled, it's Internet‐dependent. Without Internet access, cloud‐based resources are likely to be unavailable. Even private clouds are often accessible via the Internet to allow users in remote locations access to network resources.Networking allows users to access virtualized servers somewhere on the Internet, enabling their company to save money by not needing to purchase hardware or software that will become obsolete in a few years.Connecting a single client to cloud resources is most often done through a web browser and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). We say single client, but it can also be dozens or hundreds of clients, each of them individually connecting to cloud resources from their own devices. A great thing about this access type is that every client device, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, has a built‐in web browser.","","9781119642237","10.1002/9781119642138.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821813.pdf&bkn=9820852&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Protocols;TCPIP;Ethernet;Wireless fidelity;US Department of Defense;Browsers","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The initial roots of data privacy are found in the most basic Human Rights enshrined under the UN Declaration on Human Rights, and subsequently echoed in the EU Convention on Human Rights. In 1960, William Prosser, a tort law scholar, delineated four distinct privacy torts – based on the cases mentioned in the Warren and Brandeis article: intrusion upon seclusion; public disclosure of private facts; false light and publicity; and appropriation. Data privacy had initial sporadic growth in Europe with France implementing its first data protection regulation as early as 1970. One of the catalysts for commercialization of data collection and sharing without providing individuals' consent was the Gramm‐Leach‐Bliley Act of 1999.","","9781119594253","10.1002/9781119594307.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823199.pdf&bkn=9820836&pdfType=chapter","","Privacy;Data privacy;Law;History;Social networking (online);Data collection;Media","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

There are two cycles within the incident response process. First, Detection and Analysis provides information that is used during Containment, Eradication, and Recovery, with the information gained performing Containment, Eradication, and Recovery feedback to improve Detection and Analysis capabilities. Second, lessons learned through Post‐Incident Activity feed information back to improve Preparation.

Stakeholder management begins with understanding the relationship between interest and influence, the scope of stakeholder interests, and processes for managing stakeholders. A stakeholder has an interest when the outcome of an initiative, like a software development project, may affect the stakeholder. When a stakeholder has influence, that stakeholder can help direct the outcomes of an initiative. Stakeholders have varying degrees of interest. A project is an initiative focused on completing some organizational t task. Projects have budgets specifying the funding available for the project.

Spiral methodologies drop the strict requirement of not returning to an earlier stage in the process. Spiral methodologies use similar phases to waterfall methodologies, but instead of trying to complete each stage for the entire application, spiral approaches work on only a limited set of functionalities at a time. After all the stages have been completed for one set of functionalities, stakeholders determine what to work on next, and the process begins again. Spiral models are designed to reduce risk in application development. Agile methodologies are increasingly being used for software development.

The critical human disorders related to lung, kidney, skin, and brain have been successfully diagnosed using different data mining and machine learning techniques. In the last few years, substantial cases of neurological disorders have been acknowledged. Therefore, an advanced and united solution is needed that can offer a therapeutic opinion to individual neurological disorder patients. To handle the rising burden of these human disorders, and the development of a neurological disorder diagnostic framework, the rigorous attention is required from the worldwide health community, data scientists, and artificial intelligence experts. Furthermore, while designing an advanced and automated neurological disorder diagnostic framework, one has to face different challenges related to data storage, data sharing, visualization, real‐time data collection, big data, and precise data analysis. Many of these issues can be resolved by using promising areas like machine learning, nature‐inspired computing, visualization techniques, internet of things (IoT), big data analytics, and cloud computing. The intention of this work is to propose an intelligent neurological disorder diagnostic framework using an amalgamation of different emerging computing concepts like IoT, big data, machine learning, and nature‐inspired computing techniques. In the proposed framework, IoT devices will help in collecting, transmitting, and processing real‐time data of patients. While the size of health care databases grows at an exceptional rate, it seems to be intractable to handle the mountain of data using traditional techniques. Big data techniques is preferred to manage and mine momentous volume of the data. Different preprocessing techniques will be used to clean and normalize the data. The use of different machine learning and nature‐inspired computing techniques will assist in getting a better rate of disease classification.In this chapter, initially, several neurological and psychological disorders are discussed. The role of different computing techniques in designing different biomedical application has been presented. In addition, the focus shall be on highlighting the challenges and promising areas of innovation in designing a smart and intelligent neurological disorder diagnostic system using big data, IOT, and emerging computing techniques. Finally, a smart and intelligent neurological disorder diagnostic framework is proposed.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822880.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Neurological diseases;Internet of Things;Diseases;Spinal cord;Psychology;Big Data;X-ray imaging","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

YouTube digital ecosystem, and more specifically the “vlogging” digital genre, it is a “prescribed techno‐genre”, according to Paveau's typology. Relationality is intrinsic to the vlog, especially in the relationships that the vlogger maintains through the “like” or “dislike” buttons, or the comments with his or her audience. Vlogging can be a space for exchanges about politics not only with vloggers, but also between Internet users. Active since June 15, 2015, the channel “Osons Causer” defines its videos as “intellectual self‐defense to understand the news, politics and the world”. Indeed, on YouTube, Internet users grab political information and popularize it, thus paving the way for an alternative citizen form of political educational journalism.

It covers popular properties of quantum mechanics, such as the photoelectric effect, wave‐particle duality, probabilities, the uncertainty principle, spin states, tunneling, superposition, the observer effect, and quantum entanglement. There are 12 fundamental quantum particles that make up all matter in the universe. Although our entire reality is made up of quantum particles and actions, quantum mechanics happens at the very microscopic level on very, very small elemental objects, such as photons, quarks, electrons, and atoms. The probability principle applies to any property of a quantum particle, not just electrons. A principle, which is incredibly important to quantum information science, is the no‐cloning theorem, which says quantum states cannot be directly copied. Quantum tunneling is involved in some types of quantum computing. Quantum mechanics is responsible for computer microprocessors, transistors, resistors, and all integrated circuits.","","9781119618218","10.1002/9781119618232.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822533.pdf&bkn=9820848&pdfType=chapter","","Quantum mechanics;Quantum computing;Stars;Dogs;Computers;Photonics;Particle measurements","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A Java operator is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literals‐referred to as operands‐and that returns a result. The term operand, which we'll use throughout this chapter, refers to the value or variable the operator is being applied to. The output of the operation is simply referred to as the result. Increment and decrement operators, ++ and ‐‐, respectively, can be applied to numeric variables and have a high order of precedence, as compared to binary operators. In other words, they often get applied first in an expression. Increment and decrement operators require special care because the order in which they are attached to their associated variable can make a difference in how an expression is processed. If the operator is placed before the operand, referred to as the pre‐increment operator and the pre‐decrement operator, then the operator is applied first and the value returned is the new value of the expression. Alternatively, if the operator is placed after the operand, referred to as the post‐increment operator and the post‐decrement operator, then the original value of the expression is returned, with operator applied after the value is returned.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821561.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Symbols;Codes;Casting;Mathematics;Animals;Terminology","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter examines what computation does to data and knowledge in general, and then more specifically in data sciences. It looks at how computation is mobilized in the natural sciences in the context of simulation, numerical computation and data processing of scientific instruments. The various computational techniques used in data mining have been the subject of numerous attempts to classify them according to their origin, function or theoretical basis. Statistics and data science can be seen as two mutually contradictory mathematical and computational theories based on different standards of validity. The contribution of statistics to data sciences, through its methods and techniques, is not an isolated phenomenon: several historical lines mobilizing computational or pre‐computational data processing have been aggregated in the melting pot of data sciences.","","9781119777007","10.1002/9781119777014.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823229.pdf&bkn=9820910&pdfType=chapter","","Instruments;Production;Computational modeling;Data models;Big Data;Stars;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Obtaining evidence across international boundaries is particularly difficult and expensive for civilian investigators. Whereas criminal investigators may benefit from using Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties to assist their investigations, civilian investigators have no such formal support. An investigator may be employed to provide a report to management to support a cyber‐insurance claim. With the dynamic nature of digital evidence, assessing the extent of the crime and its associated cost may prove difficult. Understanding these challenges is a skill learned by experience only. Lessons learned will be incorporated into the updated incident response plan, but also into the collective knowledge of the investigation team.

It is also a source of knowledge or a truth maker in that it evidences what it represents. This chapter assesses knowledge through the prism of an approach that is not realistic, but rather pragmatic, which tightly articulates the notions of knowledge and action. Data science is a specific form of pragmatism, where knowledge from big data processing is only known because it facilitates decision‐making in a company and that decision will somehow be translated into action. The different configurations for producing knowledge from big data generate actions that can in turn be measured. Data sciences not only generate knowledge that can have practical consequences but also assess those consequences.

Writing a penetration test report is different from the act of writing a security advisory, which normally contains technical information pertinent only to one or more (related) vulnerabilities, as a report requires the translation of technical knowledge to often nontechnical audiences. One method for scoring issues or vulnerabilities is with the Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System (CVSS). There are different versions of this scoring system.

The reality is that many organizations will be hybrid for a long time, potentially forever, and removing the distinction related to supported applications and services between on premises and the cloud provides huge benefit. It is important to understand what exactly Azure Stack is and, for many organizations, when it should be used. Additionally, the exact capabilities that are supported are critical as part of planning. During the initial setup, a number of settings must be defined, and walking through these will help you to explore some of the relationship between Azure Stack and the public cloud. Azure Stack is an appliance (also known as an integrated system) and is purchased in blocks of nodes that can be thought of as a scale unit. At the time of writing, Azure Stack can be purchased as 4 to 16 node systems. If 16 nodes are not enough to meet capacity requirements, then you can deploy multiple Azure Stack systems as separate clusters. A growing number of hardware vendors sell Azure Stack. Although a hardware provider (for example, Dell), provides the physical hardware (to Microsoft's very specific Azure Stack specification) and Microsoft provides the OS and software, there is a single support contact.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822758.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Hardware;Servers;Organizations;Operating systems;Task analysis;Writing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Citizen environmental initiatives have often emerged on an individual basis through different digital photo and video sharing platforms – for example, on Fotolia, Flickr, Dailymotion and YouTube – within blogs and digital social networks. This chapter proposes the basis of exploratory empirical research, an overview of the reality of digital engagement in Quebec for the environment. Online collectives open up new spaces for “ordinary” citizens who want to get involved and express their support for an environmental cause. Facebook is by far the platform with the largest number of citizen groups in the environmental field. Emblematic digital spaces, including Facebook, thereby constitute a laboratory for networking among citizens about connected collective action and a place for the emergence of a collective “we” around environmental issues.","","9781119694823","10.1002/9781119694885.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821997.pdf&bkn=9820887&pdfType=chapter","","Social networking (online);Blogs;Market research;Internet;Video on demand;Oils;Pipelines","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The author then fine‐tunes definitions by introducing the security models that cryptologists use, including perfect secrecy, concrete security, indistinguishability and the random oracle model. He shows how the more important cryptographic algorithms actually work, and how they can be used to protect data. Whitened block ciphers are used in some applications, most specifically in the XTS mode of operation which the author discusses in this chapter.

Routers use routing protocols to dynamically find all networks within the greater internetwork and to ensure that all routers have the same routing table. Routing protocols are also employed to determine the best path a packet should take through an internetwork to get to its destination most efficiently. RIP, RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPF are great examples of the most common routing protocols. Once all routers know about all networks, a routed protocol can be used to send user data (packets) through the established enterprise. Routed protocols are assigned to an interface and determine the method of packet delivery. Examples of routed protocols are IP and IPv6. The term routing refers to taking a packet from one device and sending it through the internetwork to another device on a different network. Routers don't really care about hosts‐they only care about networks and the best path to each one of them. The logical network address of the destination host is key to getting packets through a routed network. It's the hardware address of the host that's used to deliver the packet from a router and ensure it arrives at the correct destination host.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821816.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","Routing;Routing protocols;IP networks;Codes;Videos;Task analysis;Logic gates","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

While the IaaS functionality in Azure is very rich, it should not be considered “first choice” in many scenarios; instead, PaaS should be examined as a possible compute solution. By having knowledge of the possible options, you can make the right architectural decisions, although the focus of this chapter will be around the IaaS solutions. One reason IaaS is so popular as an initial cloud service to consume by customers is that it's easy to understand and relate to. Organizations have been using virtualization for years and understand the idea about taking a piece of hardware and dividing that hardware up into virtual machines that have a subset of the available resources assigned, primary CPU, memory, and storage, but there are other types of resources, such as network bandwidth. Virtual machines bring a number of benefits to organizations, with some of the primary ones being better utilization of hardware and faster provisioning of environments.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821685.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Costs;Servers;Virtualization;Licenses;Virtual machining;Virtual machine monitors","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Anderson",NA,"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems","","2020","","","549","570","Many computer systems rely to some extent on secure printing, packaging and seals to guarantee important aspects of their protection. Seals were used to authenticate documents in the ancient Mediterranean and China. Supply‐chain security involves problems of packaging and seals. Most seals work by applying some kind of security printing to a substrate to get a tag and then fixing this tag to the material to be protected. Many seals are vulnerable to direct removal using only hand tools and a little patience. A common vulnerability is that supplies of sealing materials are uncontrolled. This chapter suggests a systematic way to evaluate a seal product for a given application. Sealing has to be evaluated over the whole lifetime of the seal from manufacture through materials control, application, verification and eventual destruction; hostile testing is highly advisable in critical applications.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823030.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Seals;Printing;Security;Ink;Inspection;Forgery;Color","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Understanding network security","C. Panek",NA,"Security Fundamentals","","2020","","","133","186","This chapter describes several security solutions and discusses how these security solutions can be used to address the challenges you may encounter. Firewalls remain the foundation of network security technologies. There are a number of options, types, and technologies associated with selecting, implementing, and maintaining the firewalls in a network. There are also a number of factors that help determine the proper solution to meet business requirements. A firewall is a system that is designed l to protect a computer or a computer network from network‐based attacks. A firewall does this by filtering the data packets traversing the network. There are numerous variations on this model, but ultimately a firewall protects hosts on one network from hosts on another network. These network connections may be referenced using different labels: internal and external, clean and dirty, secure and unsecure, local and remote, and so on. They all refer to the same model, but occasionally may need translation into familiar terminology. Any discussion about network security requires a discussion and understanding of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model. The OSI model is a conceptual model, created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1978 and revised in 1984, to describe a network architecture that allows data to be passed between computer systems. While never fully utilized as the model for a protocol, the OSI model is the standard for discussing how networking works.","","9781119650706","10.1002/9781119650737.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822940.pdf&bkn=9820863&pdfType=chapter","","Firewalls (computing);Security;Network security;Computational modeling;Physical layer;Protocols;Internet","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a series of steps that software engineers follow to create, deploy, and maintain complicated software systems. Software development begins with requirements. There is some problem that needs to be solved. Some problems are relatively narrow and lend themselves to obvious solutions. For example, addressing a new business requirement, such as enabling the ordering of new types of products, is pretty straightforward. At this point, the focus is on the business or organizational problem that is to be solved. This requires a combination of domain knowledge about the problem area and software and systems knowledge to understand how to frame a solution. Domain knowledge is often provided by people with direct experience with the requirements. Once the scope of the problem is decided, you should consider options for solving the problem. There may be multiple ways to address a business need, from modifying an existing system to building a new service from scratch. A common question at this stage is, “Should the organization buy a software solution or build one?” Commercial off‐the‐shelf software (COTS) is a term that you may hear to describe existing software solutions.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822534.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Software;Business;Costs;Insurance;Codes;User interfaces;Testing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Since most websites/web apps use content management systems (CMSs), WIG is a good way to quickly identify which CMS the target is using. CMS systems power a large majority of modern websites, so being able to identify which CMS is in use at a target website is a fairly important first step in determining the direction for the rest of the engagement. Similar to what users did while using WIG, CMSMap will scan multiple sites included in a target file. CMSMap is focused on providing functionality to multiple types of CMS systems, whereas WPScan provides advanced features solely focused on WordPress sites.","","9781119540892","10.1002/9781119541004.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822578.pdf&bkn=9820814&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Internet;History;Browsers;Uniform resource locators;Robots;Organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Governance and risk","Q. Docter; C. Fuchs",NA; NA,"CompTIA Cloud Essentials+ Study Guide: Exam CLO-002","","2020","","","215","252","This chapter recognizes risk management concepts related to cloud services. Compliance is a word that can make people groan in annoyance or that they ignore with apathy. Most seasoned IT professionals view compliance requirements as busywork or just documentation. They feel it takes time away from real work. However, for large organizations and for any organization in certain fields (banking, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, government, etc.), compliance is critical to operations.When we measure risk, we are talking about risk that can affect assets. So, we need to explore and understand assets more. Assets are any items that have value to a company. This value is measured through either a quantitative risk assessment or a qualitative risk assessment. Quantitative risk assessment deals with dollar amounts. It attempts to assign a monetary value to the elements of risk or the assets themselves. Qualitative risk assessment deals with the quality of risk or assets. It will rank the threats based on experience, intuition, or a specific scenario. Hardware on the surface should be easy to track. A hardware device can be seen or touched or can be scanned once it registers with the network or our cloud management console. Organizations will use databases or automated applications to perform inventories and track hardware through its life cycle. Software by its nature is more difficult to inventory than hardware; it is not physical. Inventorying software is just as important, if not more important. An inaccurate software inventory can have significant financial impact and security risk. It is important that software inventory be accurate and up to date. Otherwise, unlicensed software can and will be used in an organization.","","9781119642237","10.1002/9781119642138.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822020.pdf&bkn=9820852&pdfType=chapter","","Risk management;Security;Ice;Companies;Portable computers;Credit cards;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Companies often want an open source intelligence (OSINT) assessment because they need insight into what a bad actor might learnthrough the same types of activities. This chapter assumes that the client (referred to as the target) has requested a more comprehensive and explicitly defined OSINT review. It shows how to probe systems and send packets directly to the target, referred to as the active phase of the assessment. A typical OSINT review will start with manual browsing the Web, looking for information related to the target. The idea of Google dorking is to find sensitive information that was inadvertently made public and that can be found with nothing more than a Google search.

The process of growing trees relies on a top‐down partitioning algorithm that is known as the recursive binary splitting, as it is based on a splitting criterion that makes it possible to choose at each tree node (i.e. a subset of observations), the best split, i.e. binary division into two subgroups. This chapter discusses the behavior of alternative splitting criteria for Combination of Uniform and shifted Binomial (CUB) model‐based trees. It illustrates the structure of CUB regression model tree and tests the splitting criteria. The chapter presents the results of an application to data on stress perception from the official European Working Condition Survey and compares the procedure with other tree methods for ordinal responses.","","9781119721826","10.1002/9781119721871.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821560.pdf&bkn=9820902&pdfType=chapter","","Uncertainty;Indexes;Random variables;Probability distribution;Partitioning algorithms;Impurities;Data models","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Designing for Security and Legal Compliance","D. Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect Study Guide","","2020","","","127","150","This chapter covers the key objectives of Professional Cloud Architect Certification exam: designing for security and designing for security legal compliance. The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service is designed to allow you to specify what operations specific users can perform on particular resources. This is also described as specifying “who gets to do what on which resources.” IAM is the recommended way to control access in most cases. In some limited cases, such as in a development environment, the older primitive roles system may be used. An identity is an entity that represents a person or other agent that performs actions on a GCP resource. Identities are sometimes called members. Google accounts are used by people and represent people who interact with GCP, such as developers and administrators. These accounts are designated by an email address that is linked to a Google account. For example, jane.doe@gmail.com could be an identity in GCP. The domain of the email does not have to be gmail.com; it just has to be associated with a Google account. Service accounts are used by applications running in GCP. These are used to give applications their own set of access controls instead of relying on using a person's account for permissions. Service accounts are also designated by email addresses.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823165.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Engines;Organizations;Law;Access control;Task analysis;Virtual machining","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Defining Network Infrastructures and Network Security","C. Panek",NA,"Networking Fundamentals","","2020","","","259","287","This chapter focuses on the role of network infrastructures and network security. The biggest wide area network of them all is the Internet. Obviously, it is well‐known as the World Wide Web, but it is not as well‐known for other services that reside on the Internet, or the inner workings of the Internet. Other technologies, such as intranets and extranets, enable organizations to communicate with and share data with other organizations in a secure manner using the inherent properties of the Internet but in a privatized way. Virtual private networks often come into play when it comes to intranets and extranets. They are used to create secure connections that can cross over public networks. The Internet is the largest WAN in the world. It is a public domain available to everyone in the United States, and is available to most other countries as well. This section defines the Internet and the way it functions. The Internet is a worldwide system of connected computer networks. The computers that connect to the Internet use the TCP/IP protocol suite. It is estimated that there are 2 billion users of the Internet, and an estimated 650 million computers connect to the Internet, although it is difficult to estimate this due to NAT and other similar services. The origins of the Internet can be traced back to the United States' ARPANET, which was developed for government security purposes; however, this was a disjointed group of networks using deprecated or non‐uniform protocols.","","9781119650713","10.1002/9781119650768.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821936.pdf&bkn=9820864&pdfType=chapter","","Internet;Extranets;Protocols;Organizations;Companies;Authentication;Web sites","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Cyberspace offers criminal opportunities: digital services and infrastructures are a gateway to malicious intent. Any connected equipment is hackable; it is necessary to ensure continuity between physical security and cybersecurity. Cyber espionage is the highest risk for organizations. Cryptojacking or cryptocurrency mining consists of using the power of the victim's computer to undermine cryptocurrency. Online fraud is a permanent cyber threat, both for companies and large organizations and for individuals. Large companies are better protected: they invest, detect and protect themselves. Technologies are constantly evolving, and the development of artificial intelligence, Big Data and cloud computing is forcing players to quickly renew solutions.

"Working with Networking Services","C. Panek",NA,"Networking Fundamentals","","2020","","","199","229","This chapter describes how to install and configure DHCP, DNS, WINS, and Terminal Services, and discusses other technologies, such as RAS and IPsec. Networking services, such as DHCP and Terminal Services, are common in Microsoft networking environments. These help to automate processes that would otherwise be done manually by a network administrator. They also allow greater connectivity for a much broader group of computing solutions. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) sends IP information to clients automatically, making configuration of IP on the network easier and automated. It uses a four‐step process known as DORA when disseminating IP addresses. DHCP uses ports 67 and 68. To better understand how to work with DHCP on the server and on the client side, it is necessary to discuss how DHCP works. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows properly configured client computers to obtain IP addresses automatically from a DHCP server. This is done so that a network administrator does not have to manually configure IP addresses on all of the computers on the network individually. The DHCP server takes care of this task quickly and automatically. This protocol reduces the amount of system administration, allowing devices to be added to the network with little or no manual intervention.","","9781119650713","10.1002/9781119650768.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821991.pdf&bkn=9820864&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;IP networks;Computers;Protocols;Virtual private networks;Routing;Unicast","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Functional programming is a way of writing code more declaratively. You specify what you want to do rather than dealing with the state of objects. You focus more on expressions than loops. Functional programming uses lambda expressions to write code. A lambda expression is a block of code that gets passed around. You can think of a lambda expression as an unnamed method. It has parameters and a body just like full‐fledged methods do, but it doesn't have a name like a real method. Lambda expressions are often referred to as lambdas for short. Lambdas work with interfaces that have only one abstract method. In this case, Java looks at the CheckTrait interface that has one method. The lambda indicates that Java should call a method with an Animal parameter that returns a boolean value that's the result of a.canHop(). We know all this because we wrote the code. Java relies on context when figuring out what lambda expressions mean. We are passing this lambda as the second parameter of the print () method. That method expects a CheckTrait as the second parameter.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823245.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Animals;Java;Codes;Syntactics;Writing;Functional programming;Dogs","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The sharing economy is gaining more and more ground, and this is not a “whim” in the business world. It really does exist and provides solutions to many of the problems caused by the traditional economy, which in this case, are those related to social well‐being, particularly poverty and social exclusion.

"Locks and Alarms","R. Anderson",NA,"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems","","2020","","","471","495","Most security engineers nowadays focus on electronic systems, but physical protection cannot be neglected. Physical security engineering is no different at heart from the digital variety: readers perform a threat analysis, then design a system that involves equipment and procedures, then test it. A common mistake when designing alarm systems is to be captivated by the latest sensor technology. Intruder alarms and barriers interact in a number of ways with other services. Just as the confluence of computers and telecoms saw computer‐industry equipment and methods displace the old phonecompany ways of doing things, so the automation of physical protection systems is steadily bringing the world of barriers, locks and alarms within our orbit. Alarms provide us with a good example of a system whose security policy hinges on availability rather than on confidentiality or integrity. They can give us some useful insights when dealing with service‐denial attacks in other contexts.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822781.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Buildings;Automobiles;Art;Windows;Testing;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Vectaury operates in retail analytics, i.e. the analysis of customer data for the distribution sector. Worldwide, data protection legislation (sometimes referred to as data confidentiality in third countries) is developing. Legislative texts are often influenced by European Union regulations, which are considered the benchmark for data protection.

"Identity","J. Savill",NA,"Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Services for Architects: Designing Cloud Solutions","","2020","","","95","144","This chapter focuses on two key elements of the cloud that are critical to every organization, and while they initially may seem an odd combination, they are two sides of the same coin in the cloud. A federation must be established between the organization and each cloud service, which requires certificate exchanges and configuration of token contents and claims that will be used, and these must be maintained. Additionally, the organization must maintain a federation infrastructure, which requires multiple proxy servers that are public facing behind a load balancer and which talk to a farm of actual federation servers. This all requires management. The point is, identity is everything in the cloud. When leveraging the cloud, it is the identity that is the key to accessing the service. There is no network boundary around the services you can control. To protect the application, you have to protect the identity. This means you need to have great visibility into the activities being performed by the identity in order to enable risk assessment and mitigation. Active Directory was introduced in Windows 2000 to replace the old domain technology in previous server versions. While the earlier domain implementation “worked,” it had many limitations because it was built on the old SAM database used for local account management. These limitations included only a single writable domain controller, no delegation, no understanding of physical locations, no extensibility, and a 40 MB database size limit.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822196.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Security;Authentication;Forestry;Passwords;Databases;Standards organizations","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It then explores gaps in traditional views, introduces nontraditional approaches to context for systems, and provides more detail on the “context of use” concept for advanced systems engineering. In response to technological evolution(s), advanced systems engineering should seek to more clearly and comprehensively describe operating environments – to include accounting for contextual descriptions consisting of the interrelated human behavior, social, and organizational factors that impact system performance and success. Three academic literatures – systems theory, organization science, and engineering systems – offer insights to better understand and incorporate context into advanced systems engineering. To further make the case for including the context of use in advanced systems engineering, the chapter explores improving systems engineering approaches for security at high consequence facilities.","","9781119513940","10.1002/9781119513957.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822794.pdf&bkn=9820812&pdfType=chapter","","Systems engineering and theory;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Behavioral sciences;Vehicles;Stakeholders;Manufacturing systems;Complex systems","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Business metadata define the information content that the data provide in a business context. Business metadata are an important aspect in any successful information governance program. Navigational integration metadata describe the data linkage and data movement within the environments. Operational metadata describes the data integration applications and supporting job runs.

"Designing for Reliability","D. Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect Study Guide","","2020","","","151","172","This chapter focuses on reliability from a reliability engineering perspective. A reliable system continuously provides its service. Reliability is closely related to availability. Reliability is a probability, specifically, the probability that a system will be able to process some specified workload for some period of time. Availability is a measure of the percentage of time that a system is functioning and able to meet some specified workload. The difference between reliability and availability is important to keep in mind when thinking about metrics and service‐level agreements (SLAs). Monitoring is the practice of collecting measurements of key aspects of infrastructure and applications. Examples include average CPU utilization over the past minute, the number of bytes written to a network interface, and the maximum memory utilization over the past hour. These measurements, which are known as metrics, are made repeatedly over time and constitute a time series of measurements. A time series is a set of metrics recorded with a time stamp. Often, metrics are collected at a specific interval, such as every second or every minute. A time series is associated with a monitored entity.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821720.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Measurement;Reliability;Monitoring;Time series analysis;Reliability engineering;Time measurement;Cloud computing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It's easy to start buying firewalls, but until you understand what needs to be protected, why it needs to be protected, and what it's being protected from, you're just throwing money away. When working in the security field, one of the first acronyms to be encountered in the information security field is CIA. Not to be confused with the government agency with the same acronym, in information security, this acronym represents the core goals of an information security program. These goals are: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Confidentiality is a concept we deal with frequently in real life. We expect our doctor to keep our medical records confidential. We trust our friends to keep our secrets confidential. In the business world, we define confidentiality as the characteristic of a resource‐ensuring access is restricted to only permitted users, applications, or computer systems. We define integrity in the information security context as the consistency, accuracy, and validity of data or information. One of the goals of a successful information security program is to ensure that the information is protected against any unauthorized or accidental changes. The program should include processes and procedures to manage intentional changes, as well as the ability to detect changes.","","9781119650706","10.1002/9781119650737.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822366.pdf&bkn=9820863&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Risk management;Information security;Terminology;Business;Registers;Earthquakes","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The cloud data center has to be robust and resilient to all types of threats, from natural disasters to hacking attacks to simple component failure. This strength and capability has to be comprehensive and exhaustive enough to provide close to continuous system operation and data access (referred to as uptime) for multiple customers with a wide spectrum of service needs. A vast majority of the effort to ensure continuous uptime will be spent providing redundancy of physical components and infrastructure. With sufficient replication of hardware and media, elements can be lost without impact to operations. When designing a data center, consider redundancy not only for the IT systems and infrastructure, but for all aspects of functionality that support the operation of the data center. These include utilities (electrical power receipt/distribution, water, and communications connectivity), staff, emergency capabilities (mostly power generation and fuel for same as well as egress paths for personnel), HVAC, and security controls. IT systems cannot operate without electricity. The data center will require a power source sufficient to operate all the core processing and storage systems for all customers as well as those support systems necessary to run the data center (such as HVAC and lighting).

"Understanding authentication, authorization, and accounting","C. Panek",NA,"Security Fundamentals","","2020","","","33","109","This chapter discusses how the security model was built using the three A's‐authentication, authorization, and accounting. In the realm of IT security, the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) acronym is a model for access control. Authentication is the process of identifying an individual, usually based on a user name and password. After a user is authenticated, the user can access network resources based on the user's authorization. Authorization is the process of giving individuals access to system objects based on their identity. Accounting, also known as auditing, is the process of keeping track of a user's activity while accessing the network resources, including the amount of time spent in the network, the services accessed while there, and the amount of data transferred during the session. Nonrepudiation prevents one party from denying actions they carry out. If proper authentication, authorization, and accounting have been established, a person cannot deny their own actions. Hackers will try to crack passwords by first trying obvious passwords, including the name of spouse or children, birthdays, keywords used by the user, hobbies of the user, and common passwords. Then hackers will try brute force attacks, which consist of trying as many combinations of characters as time and money permit. A subset of the brute force attack is the dictionary attack, in which all words in one or more dictionaries are tested. Lists of common passwords are also typically tested.","","9781119650706","10.1002/9781119650737.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823249.pdf&bkn=9820863&pdfType=chapter","","Passwords;Authentication;Security;Authorization;Smart cards;Encryption;Computer hacking","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Choosing Training and Serving Infrastructure","D. Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer Study Guide","","2020","","","231","246","This chapter focuses on choosing the appropriate training and serving infrastructure for your needs when serverless or specialized AI services are not a good fit for your requirements. Advances in integrated circuit and instruction set design have led to the development of specialized computing hardware accelerators. These devices offload some of the computing workload from CPUs. Graphic processing units (GPUs) are accelerators that have multiple arithmetic logic units (ALUs), which implement adders and multipliers. Modern GPUs have thousands of ALUs. This architecture is well suited to workloads that benefit from massive parallelization, such as training deep learning models. GPUs typically increase training performance on deep learning models by a factor of 10. Tensor processing units (TPUs) are specialized accelerators based on ASICs and created by Google to improve the training of deep neural networks. These accelerators are designed for the TensorFlow framework. The design of TPUs is proprietary and available only through Google's cloud services or on Google's Edge TPU devices. Single machines are useful for training small models, developing machine learning applications, and exploring data using Jupyter Notebooks or related tools. Cloud Datalab, for example, runs instances in Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs).","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822589.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Training;Computational modeling;Graphics processing units;Deep learning;Internet;Engines;Hardware acceleration","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Much of the world’s critical infrastructure utilizes supervisory control and data acquisition systems, which automatically monitor and adjust switching, manufacturing, and other process control activities based on digitized feedback data gathered by sensors. Systems engineers are accustomed to designing technical approaches to cybersecurity utilizing network maps and schematics that detail layers of information and their interconnections. While obviously useful, future such approaches may be enhanced by integrating qualitative factors into the design process, encompassing an organization’s strategy and objectives, and focusing on the people, processes, and technology required to achieve such objectives.

Cryptography is the art and science of “secret writing” and has been used for thousands of years to provide its users with some degree of protection for their messages, documents, and other information. Cryptography provides powerful ways to prove that a document or a file is what it claims to be and keep it secret and safe. It authenticates people and organizations as well. The transparency, reliability, and integrity of information are all enhanced by smart use of cryptographic systems and techniques. Criminals, too, make use of it; there was no practical way to keep cryptography secret and make it the province of princes and presidents only. There's an oversimplification that many information systems users, and their managers, often fall prey to‐the belief that if you just “sprinkle a little crypto dust” over your systems, you can almost magically make them totally secure. It's natural perhaps to think this way, since cryptography seems to be pervasive; it's everywhere we look.","","9781119601968","10.1002/9781119601951.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822379.pdf&bkn=9820841&pdfType=chapter","","Cryptography;Encryption;Information security;Information systems;Data privacy;Transforms;Reliability","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It also focuses on the steps recommended by Cisco when troubleshooting an IP network. It's common for a host, router, or other network device to be configured with the wrong IP address, subnet mask, or default gateway. Because this happens way too often, you must know how to find and fix IP address configuration errors. A good way to start is to draw out the network and IP addressing scheme. If that's already been done, consider yourself lucky because though sensible, it's rarely done. Even if it is, it's usually outdated or inaccurate anyway. So either way, it's a good idea to bite the bullet and start from scratch. Once you have your network accurately drawn out, including the IP addressing scheme, you need to verify each host's IP address, mask, and default gateway address to establish the problem. Of course, this is assuming that you don't have a physical layer problem, or if you did, that you've already fixed it.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821739.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Servers;Operating systems;Logic gates;Videos;TCPIP;Protocols","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Sadiqui","Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Morocco","Computer Network Security","","2020","","","67","78","This chapter focuses on authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA) security strategy, AAA authentication types, AAA authorizations, and AAA traceability. Local authentication enables simple and quick management of user accounts. However, this proves inefficient when there are a large number of users. AAA strategies enable the integration of users in the ""Active directory"" database in order to benefit from centralized management. AAA authorization strategies define the access parameters for a user on a router or in a network. AAA traceability makes it possible to log all actions carried out by a user in the events log. By doing this, it will be possible to consult the logs to verify user actions or to identify the author of a given action in order to rapidly intervene in the case of a problem. AAA supports six different types of traceability: system, network, exec, commands, connection and resource.","","9781119706748","10.1002/9781119706762.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821679.pdf&bkn=9820894&pdfType=chapter","","Authentication;Servers;Authorization;Protocols;Passwords;IP networks;Databases","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Designing for Technical Requirements","D. Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect Study Guide","","2020","","","49","68","This chapter considers three broad categories of technical requirements: high availability; scalability and reliability. High availability is the continuous operation of a system at sufficient capacity to meet the demands of ongoing workloads. Availability is usually measured as a percent of time that a system is available and responding to requests with latency not exceeding some certain threshold. High availability SLAs, such as these, have to account for the fact that hardware and software fails. Individual physical components, such as a disk drive running in a particular disk array, may have a small probability of failing in a one‐month period. High availability also comes from the use of redundant VMs. Managed instance groups are the best way to create a cluster of VMs, all running the same services in the same configuration. A managed instance group uses an instance template to specify the configuration of each VM in the group. Instance templates specify machine type, boot disk image, and other VM configuration details. If a VM in the instance group fails, another one will be created using the instance template. Managed instance groups (MIGs) provide other features that help improve availability. A VM may be operating correctly, but the application running on the VM may not be functioning as expected. Instance groups can detect this using an application‐specific health check. If an application fails the health check, the managed instance group will create a new instance. This feature is known as auto‐healing.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822190.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Engines;Servers;Technical requirements;Software;Hardware;Codes;Reliability","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Generalized hyperbolic distributions have become quite popular in various areas of both theoretical and applied statistics. In applied probability, GH models were introduced as the distributions of randomly stopped Brownian motion with the stopping times having some generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. The chapter provides many of the limiting forms of MGH distribution by modifying various parameters. It considers a study of the conditional generalized hyperbolic distribution. In analyzing and empirically testing a process that jointly follows an MGH distribution, expressions of conditional densities are also of importance. The chapter also considers methodologies of how these expressions can be formed and extend the results by further deriving various limiting conditional forms.","","9781119721826","10.1002/9781119721871.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821695.pdf&bkn=9820902&pdfType=chapter","","Manganese;Limiting;Random variables;IEEE Sections;Gaussian distribution;Data models;Data analysis","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Monitoring leads into and is part of the overall security considerations for Azure. A number of the Azure monitoring and security solutions can also expand beyond Azure to bring benefit to on premises and even other clouds. Some technologies have even been rebranded and assimilated into Azure Monitor to further cement Azure Monitor's place as the definitive monitoring entry point. There are a large number of reasons to monitor anything, not just Azure, not just computer systems. We monitor our cars. We check the fuel gauge to know when we need to add more fuel; cars have alerts to let us know when the fuel is critically low in case we are not paying attention. We are monitoring to ensure the car is healthy; we are monitoring to ensure the care is performing as expected; and we are monitoring to ensure it is secure. Every organization has different drivers that will impact the exact goals for monitoring and the monitoring implemented, but there are some general categories that are widely adopted. The key point is that monitoring is required and, like many things, just because the cloud is utilized does not mean the customer has no responsibility related to monitoring. The exact responsibilities, however, will vary depending on the type of service. Where the customer is responsible for the monitoring, there are capabilities in Azure to assist and gain meaning from the data gathered in addition to alerting as required.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823228.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Monitoring;Measurement;Security;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Telemetry;Feeds","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Governance","J. Savill",NA,"Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Services for Architects: Designing Cloud Solutions","","2020","","","47","94","This chapter focuses on the considerations and technologies to assist when applying governance to Azure services. While often initially overlooked, governance is critical to ensure that deployments meet company and regulatory requirements and also enable a more consistent and supportable environment. Governance should be one of the first work items when looking at using the cloud and will ultimately provide a securer and auditable deployment with some upfront effort. Many eons ago (well, a few years at least), the only way to host applications was to run them in your datacenter. This required significant investment, as facilities were required to hold large, expensive servers and their supporting infrastructure components, such as storage and networking. As applications moved from running on dedicated hardware to virtual machines, a problem manifested, as it now became easier to create resources, which resulted in virtual machine sprawl. Without the right guardrails, VMs would be created. There was little control or stewardship of VMs, and there was no way to track if VMs were still needed or even being used. On the business side, there was often no downside or cost to requesting VM after VM. The only restriction on an explosion of VMs was often the process to actually create a VM. Today, most businesses are moving to the cloud for a variety of reasons, but one of the biggest is digital transformation to enable the organization to stay relevant and complete in the market.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821701.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Organizations;Standards organizations;Costs;Cloud computing;Digital transformation;Virtual machining;Testing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The global, decentralized nature of cloud computing presents numerous issues that we are just now grappling with in our endeavors to protect privacy rights, meet compliance demands, and maintain a secure computing environment. This chapter covers effective risk management, risk metrics, and strategies for an effective risk management program. Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization's risk tolerance. Cloud computing as it exists today has commoditized compute, storage and networking services. Enterprise risk management has shifted in response to this change. It is vitally important that both the customer and the provider focus on risk management and the challenges presented with cloud computing.

This has prompted a great deal of interest in MDM. Master data can be described by the way it interacts with other data. In transaction systems, master data is almost always involved with transactional data.

When a system cannot be taken offline to create a forensic image, it is best to collect the digital evidence on that system to create an image while the system is still running, a live image. Running an imaging tool on the local system is likely to cause minor changes to the data on the disk, such as registry entries for external storage connected during the imaging process. Dead‐box imaging is used where the original device's operating system is not being executed and changes to the original media are blocked. Common imaging tools include FTK Imager Magnet Acquire, and EnCase Forensic. Either running FTK Imager locally on the virtual machine or installing a remote agent such as F‐Response to gain access to it across the wire is a viable approach to gathering information from a running virtual machine.","","9781119560289","10.1002/9781119560302.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821796.pdf&bkn=9820823&pdfType=chapter","","Media;Imaging;Operating systems;Digital forensics;Streaming media;Servers;Random access memory","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

A main goal of dimension reduction is data visualization. This chapter reviews the extension of principal component analysis (PCA) to the interval‐valued data, followed by a brief description of the classic SIR. It considers different families of symbolic‐numerical‐symbolic approaches to extend SIR to the interval‐valued data. The chapter evaluates the implemented interval SIR methods and compare the results with those of interval PCA for low‐dimensional discriminative and visualization purposes by means of simulation studies. The analysis of interval‐valued data usually serves as the basic principle for analyzing other types of symbolic data, such as multi‐valued data, modal‐valued data, and modal multi‐valued data. The advantage of the distributional approaches is that the resulting symbolic covariance matrix fully utilizes all the information in the data.","","9781119695103","10.1002/9781119695110.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822320.pdf&bkn=9820889&pdfType=chapter","","Principal component analysis;Dimensionality reduction;Data visualization;Input variables;Random variables;Numerical models;Arithmetic","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Getting protection right thus depends on several different types of process. Readers need to ensure that the people who will guard the system and maintain it are properly motivated. In this chapter, the author sets out a framework for thinking about this. Then, in order to illustrate the range of different things that security and safety systems have to do, he takes a quick look at four application areas: a bank, a military base, a hospital, and the home. The author provides a few brief examples of interesting security systems and what they're designed to prevent.

Digital humanists argue that digital technologies generate an ethos that revolutionizes knowledge. This chapter takes the opposite path to show that the social sciences and philosophy had already been shaken by the non‐digital communication system and that the digital humanities are rather the ethos that flows from that system. Like the most recent trends in the sociology of knowledge, the reflection of the digital humanities takes as its starting point the practices of social agents. As a sociocultural phenomenon, the digital humanities can be seen as an indicator of a system of values and meaning, an epistemology that crosses intellectual practices and shapes the frameworks of knowledge production in a contemporary way.","","9781119694823","10.1002/9781119694885.ch16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823226.pdf&bkn=9820887&pdfType=chapter","","Humanities;Philosophical considerations;Media;Production;Social sciences;Reflection;Communication systems","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Supervised learning algorithms are used to make predictions. When an ML model is used to predict a discrete value, it is known as a classification model. When a model is used to predict a continuous value, it is known as a regression model. Unsupervised learning algorithms find patterns in data without using predefined labels. Two commonly used forms of unsupervised learning are clustering and anomaly detection. Unsupervised algorithms learn by starting with unlabeled data and then identifying salient features, such as groups or clusters, and anomalies in a data stream. Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected patterns in data. Anomalies come in a variety of forms. Point anomalies are outliers, such as a credit card transaction with an unusually large amount. Contextual anomalies are unusual patterns given other features of an instance. For example, purchasing a large number of umbrellas in a desert area is contextually anomalous. Reinforcement learning is an approach to learning that uses agents interacting with an environment and adapting behavior based on rewards from the environment. This form of learning does not depend on labels.","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822126.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Animals;Prediction algorithms;Classification algorithms;Logistics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Network simulators enable an architect or network engineer to build and assess an experimental model of a network. This chapter introduces graphical network simulator‐3 (GNS3) which is a graphical network emulator that is free to use, open source and reliable. GNS3 is based on three concepts: simulation, emulation and virtualization. Emulation does not allow modeling, but actually identically reproduces the behavior of a software program and its hardware architecture.

But, the complexities of present‐day transportation can't be managed by the previous systems. For instance, the information gathered by the advancements of the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are progressively intricate and are portrayed by heterogeneous devices, huge volume, mistakes in spatial and transient procedures, and continuous necessities of real‐time processing. Traditional data processing, data analysis tools, and integration do not solve the processing task of complex ITSs. The utilization of intelligent data analysis (IDA) frameworks and strategies, with compelling information gathering and data dispersion frameworks, gives openings that are required to building the future ITSs.In this chapter, we will exhibit the application of IDA in internet of things (IoT)‐based ITS. We give a summary of the sources and qualities of ITS information, examining the relationship of ITS to IDA. We will talk about procedures required for the initial phase in managing huge and complex data, which is to coordinate and incorporate information that can be invarious formats and received from different sources. This IDA enable users to investigate transportation information in the most widely recognized formats. It will present the idea of systems engineering and its part in planning frameworks for use in the IoT, with specific accentuation on ITS. Configuration is a fundamental advance in the making up of a framework, as the outline plots the course that later improvement steps will take. It includes the formation of an engineering that speaks to the framework to be developed, and this design is broke down to guarantee that the framework, as planned, is prepared to effectively meet necessities. The internet and the cellphone keep on proliferating around the world. As they end up using essential specialized apparatuses for individuals around the globe, the use of online life applications, similar to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, is ending up more well‐known each day.

Some tools focus on specific use cases, such as data acquisition, whereas other tools focus on a broader set of functionalities. Commercial incident response tools are proprietary software developed for licensing and sale. Because developers of commercial incident response tools cater to a niche market, the software often comes with a hefty price tag. Open source incident response tools are available at no cost, and enterprises do not have to pay licensing fees to developers.","","9781119679356","10.1002/9781119679349.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822192.pdf&bkn=9820878&pdfType=chapter","","Software;Task analysis;Open source software;Forensics;Costs;Hardware;Data acquisition","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

An exception indicates something unexpected happened. A method can handle an exception by catching it or declaring it for the caller to deal with. Many exceptions are thrown by Java libraries. You can throw your own exceptions with code such as throw new Exception (). All exceptions inherit Throwable. Subclasses of Error are exceptions that a programmer should not attempt to handle. Classes that inherit RuntimeException and Error are runtime (unchecked) exceptions. Classes that inherit Exception, but not RuntimeException, are checked exceptions. Java requires checked exceptions to be handled with a catch block or declared with the throws keyword. A try statement must include at least one catch block or a finally block. A multicatch block is one that catches multiple unrelated exceptions in a single catch block. If a try statement has multiple catch blocks chained together, at most one catch block can run. Java looks for an exception that can be caught by each catch block in the order they appear, and the first match is run. Then execution continues after the try statement. If both catch and finally throw an exception, the one from finally gets thrown.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822813.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Codes;Indexes;Internet;Encoding;Animals;Writing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

To explore the options and constraints, he discusses networking protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol, Domain Name System and SMTP and the service‐denial attacks that can result from their abuse. The author then takes a closer look at malware, and then at defensive technologies such as filtering and intrusion detection and how defenders can coordinate them. In defending against malware and network attack generally, the readers needed three things: good enough management; firewalls to stop known Trojans and network exploits; and intrusion detection to monitor readers' networks and machines for indicators of compromise so they can catch the stuff that got through and clean up afterwards. Next, the author surveys the limitations of widely‐used crypto protocols such as TLS, secure shell and IPsec, and the particularly tricky role of certification authorities. Finally, he returns to network architecture.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823077.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Servers;Routing protocols;Resilience;Web pages;Surveillance;Sensitivity","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Data Controllers and Processors managed to evade, or at least dilute, responsibility by hiding behind the complications created by technology. The data protection policies are read with the accompanying duty of data protection by design and default, which ensures the safety of the data as the de facto setting when carrying out processing activities. Data breaches can occur due to a lack of appropriate organizational measures to protect data.

ML pipelines include several stages, beginning with data ingestion and preparation, then data segregation, followed by model training and evaluation. As in other software development processes, models, like other software, should be deployed and monitored in a structured manner. Machine learning projects begin with a problem definition. This could involve how to improve sales revenue by making product recommendations to customers, how to evaluate medical images to detect tumors, or how to identify fraudulent financial transactions. Batch data ingestion should use a dedicated process for ingesting each distinct data source. For example, one process may ingest sales transactions from an e‐commerce site, whereas another process ingests data about customers from another source. Batch ingestion is often done on a relatively fixed schedule, much like many data warehouse extraction, load, and transformation (ELT) processes. It is important to be able to track which batch data comes from, so you must include a batch identifier with each record that is ingested. This is considered a best practice, and it allows you to compare results across datasets more easily.","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822701.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Pipelines;Machine learning;Cloud computing;Engines;Training;Soft sensors;Monitoring","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This starts with the services provided by Azure Storage, which can be used by both infrastructure and other services, and then proceeds to VM‐specific storage architectural elements. An in‐depth knowledge of the internals of Azure Storage is not a requirement for leveraging the services. The whole point of cloud services is that, as the consumer of the service, you do not need to know or care how your services are being delivered. In most enterprise datacenters, you will find one or more storage area networks (SANs). These are very large, multirack systems that consist of hundreds, if not thousands, of enterprise disks. They are typically a mix of HDDs and SSDs. The SAN has a number of controllers, which are essentially scaled‐down operating systems, which enable access to the storage services and management. The SANs then connect to hosts that leverage the storage through various media, typically Fiber Channel and iSCSI. This requires the hosts consuming the storage to have a specific type of host bus adapter (HBA)/network card in addition to the often expensive switching equipment in the datacenter. SANs offer many benefits, including redundant connectivity, power, controllers and everything else, high levels of performance and functionality, and centralized shared storage. These benefits come at great financial cost.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821830.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Zirconium;Uniform resource locators;Computer architecture;Resilience;Costs;Servers;Integrated circuits","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Issue tracking systems maintain enormous bug reports with several attributes such as long description of bugs, threaded discussion comments, and bug meta‐data, which includes BugID, priority, status, resolution, time, and others. In this paper, bug reports of 20 open‐source projects of the Apache software foundation are extracted using a tool named Bug Report Collection System for trend analysis. As per the quantitative analysis of data, about 20% of open bugs are critical in nature, which directly impacts the functioning of the system. The presence of large number of bugs of this kind can put the system into a vulnerable position and reduces risk aversion capability. Thus, it is essential to resolve these issues on high priority. The test lead can assign these issues to the most contributing developers of a project for quick closure of opened critical bugs. The comments are mined and can help us in identifying the developers resolving the majority of bugs, which is beneficial for test leads of distinct projects. As per the collated data, the areas more prone to system failures are determined such as input/output (I/O) type error or logical code error. It will be useful for programmers to inspect these areas on high priority and researchers can uncover the reason as to why these areas are most error prone. It will help to improve the programs, in turn, improving software development and maintenance process. The overall analysis of the system gives a holistic view of various types of issues that exist in the system. The researchers will be able to identify the criticality and source of the bugs that impact system performance on a single platform.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822409.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Computer bugs;Software;Text mining;Market research;Information filters;Web sites;Task analysis","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It covers ways to capture the contents of system random access memory (RAM) to preserve them for analysis. The focus is on the collection of volatile data and an exploration of how analysis can be performed on live systems. Collection of data stored in the RAM of a local system is often conducted by attaching an external storage device to the system and running a RAM acquisition utility to copy the contents of the system memory to that external media. The Rekall memory analysis framework provides the ability to analyze offline copies of memory from a RAM acquisition and system memory on a running machine. Incident handlers must have mechanisms for collecting RAM from remote systems to handle such occurrences.

"Internetworking","T. Lammle",NA,"Understanding Cisco Networking Technologies, Volume 1: Exam 200-301","","2020","","","1","30","This chapter focuses on how to connect networks together using Cisco routers and switches. The OSI model has seven hierarchical layers that were developed to enable different networks to communicate reliably between disparate systems. Networks and networking have grown exponentially over the past 20 years, and understandably so. They've had to evolve at light speed just to keep up with huge increases in basic, mission‐critical user needs (e.g., the simple sharing of data and printers) as well as greater burdens like multimedia remote presentations, conferencing, and the like. Unless everyone who needs to share network resources is located in the same office space, which is increasingly rare, the challenge is to connect relevant networks so all users can share the wealth of whatever services and resources are required, on site or remotely. When networks first came into being, computers could typically communicate only with computers from the same manufacturer. For example, companies ran either a complete DECnet solution or an IBM solution, never both together. In the late 1970s, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model was created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to break through this barrier. The OSI model was meant to help vendors create interoperable network devices and software in the form of protocols so that different vendor networks could work in peaceable accord with each other.

"Modeling the Evolution of Technologies","Y. Shai",NA,"Systems Engineering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution: Big Data, Novel Technologies, and Modern Systems Engineering","","2020","","","563","601","Technologies never seem to cease changing and developing at an increasingly growing rate. System engineers have been challenged by this trend which affects advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0 challenges. This chapter presents a holistic approach as the basis for scientific and engineering modeling. The holistic approach recognizes that new properties and behaviors emerge when broadening the perspective and obtaining a macroscopic observation. Holism (from Greek λος, holos, a word meaning all, whole, entire, total) is the idea that “high‐level” properties of a system, whether physical, technical, biological, chemical, social, economic, etc., cannot be satisfactorily determined, explained, and described in an inductive fashion, i.e. from an inductive reasoning that makes generalizations based on the behavior of the “individuals” (component parts). In contrast, a deductive “holistic” reasoning determines how the particular system of interest behaves and performs. Again, this also applies to advanced manufacturing systems and their related supply chains. It is the system as a whole that determines the way its parts behave or perform, not the other way around. The term holism was coined by Jan Smuts (1927) as a concept that regards objects, both animate and inanimate, as “wholes” and not merely as assemblages of elements or parts and makes the existence of “wholes” a fundamental feature of the world. We apply here general principles of holistic reasoning to the reliability engineering and condition‐based maintenance field and treat particular areas of engineering, from the reliability standpoint, on a broad holistic basis of the performance of engineering objects. This chapter stretches the boundaries of reliability engineering and system failure modeling as a new line of research capable of explaining high‐level performance, life cycle characteristics, and evolutionary properties of current technologies.","","9781119513940","10.1002/9781119513957.ch22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821992.pdf&bkn=9820812&pdfType=chapter","","Technological innovation;Reliability theory;History;Genetics;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Codes;Supply chains","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a detector that can analyze packets travelling over one or more network connections in order to detect suspicious activity. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a detector that can detect and prevent any potential attack on a host or on the network. The IPS solutions offered by Cisco are designed so that they can be adapted to different environments and offer high availability and efficiency. An IPS may be deployed in two modes: promiscuous mode and inline mode. Attacks on a network may generate four types of alarms, coded as: true positive; true negative; false positive and false negative. An IPS may detect malicious traffic using several methods, including signature‐based detection, strategy‐based detection, anomaly‐based detection and reputation‐based detection.","","9781119706748","10.1002/9781119706762.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822691.pdf&bkn=9820894&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Detectors;Telecommunication traffic;Operating systems;Network security;Delays;Training","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

An IPsec frame contains five basic elements that must be configured to ensure a secured connection. They are IPsec protocol; confidentiality; integrity; authentication and Diffie‐Hellman. An IPsec Security Association (SA) makes it possible to specify the security settings associated with a communication. There are two modes in which IPsec can be used: transport mode and tunnel mode. IKE is a protocol used to dynamically negotiate the security settings associated with IPSec communication. It is the combination of three protocols, namely: ISAKMP, SKEME and Oakley.

People may have received an email telling that their message could not be delivered at some point. These “bounced” email messages are known as delivery status notifications, and they can be useful to a hacker since they still contain pieces of information added to their email during the chain as it tried to find its way.

Historically, the emergence of visualization software has greatly facilitated and spread the use of data visualization. In the fields of human–machine interfaces and ergonomics, which are concerned with data visualization and are derived in particular from cognitive sciences, visualization can be evaluated on a measurable readability criterion. Revealing the epistemic value of data entails both giving meaning to certain signs and discarding others. In the digital context, design is first associated with what is visible on the screen: the graphical user interface. It is thus assimilated to a work of graphic creation (or modification), which consists of making aesthetic an already existing interface created by the developers.","","9781119777007","10.1002/9781119777014.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821871.pdf&bkn=9820910&pdfType=chapter","","Data visualization;Graphics;Art;Visualization;Image color analysis;Software;Big Data","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The COVID‐19 pandemic looks set to increase state surveillance, with the trade‐off being not privacy versus security but privacy versus health. This chapter explores the nexus of surveillance, censorship, forensics and privacy. Talk about terrorism has driven a lot of policy around surveillance and privacy, especially since 9/11. Nowadays some services are blocked and some aren't, depending on whether the service provider is prepared to help the regime with both surveillance and censorship. The tensions between privacy and censorship may continue to work out in unpredictable ways. Privacy and data protection are one subject on which the USA and Europe have taken separate paths.

"Introduction","G. Edwards",NA,"Cybercrime Investigators Handbook","","2020","","","1","8","This introduction presents an overview of key concepts covered in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book is intended for the person assigned the task of investigating the cyber event with a view to gaining a full understanding of the event and where possible recovering the intellectual property/personally identifying information before it is exploited. They may also be tasked with finding evidence to support an action in a tribunal (e.g., employment court) or a potential prosecution in a civil or criminal court should the attacker be identified. It will also be of benefit to the manager/executive/lawyer who is tasked to review an investigation to understand the actions of the investigation team and why certain decisions were made and to gain an understanding of the evidence available from a cybercrime scene and the follow‐up investigation.","","9781119596325","10.1002/9781119596318.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821601.pdf&bkn=9820837&pdfType=chapter","","Law;Computer crime;Law enforcement;Companies;Task analysis;Security;Medical services","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Managing Azure","J. Savill",NA,"Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Services for Architects: Designing Cloud Solutions","","2020","","","359","397","This chapter focuses on a few management aspects of Azure. The primary focus will be on the best way to deploy resources, command‐line interactions, and automation. Interactions with Azure will be for different purposes, and the different options have relative advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of interaction you are performing. In the world of Windows command‐line interfaces and scripting, PowerShell is the primary technology. Because it was open sourced with PowerShell Core, it can also be leveraged on Linux and MacOS. PowerShell functionality for technologies is primarily provided through modules. There are modules for Azure (actually, a number of them), but before getting to that, I want to quickly touch on the right PowerShell to use. As previously mentioned, PowerShell was recently open sourced. This created PowerShell Core, which is distinct from Windows PowerShell that ships as part of Windows and is updated with new versions of Windows. PowerShell Core is built on .NET Core instead of the full .NET on which Windows PowerShell is built. PowerShell Core is a separate download and install and updates for more frequently than the OS‐based Windows PowerShell. There are also functionality differences because of the different .NET foundations.","","9781119596530","10.1002/9781119596608.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822755.pdf&bkn=9820838&pdfType=chapter","","Codes;Operating systems;Portals;Automation;Browsers;Writing;Visualization","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter explores various motives for cyberattacks to better understand the mindset of potential adversaries, before delving into the details of incident response. The most common motivations for an attacker are intelligence (espionage), financial gain, or disruption; however financial fraud is still a common motivator of threat actors. Cyber attackers employ methods such as denial‐of‐service (DoS) attacks, worms, ransomware, and phishing attacks. The different models that describe the attacker methodology include the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, the Unified Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK, and others. Regardless of the model, the general flow of an attack will generally follow reconnaissance, exploitation, expansion/entrenchment, exfiltration/damage and clean up. Modern adversaries have a large toolbox of attack methods from which to choose and a wide range of motivations for their attacks.","","9781119560289","10.1002/9781119560302.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822753.pdf&bkn=9820823&pdfType=chapter","","Computer crime;Supply chains;Companies;Intellectual property;Information systems;Online banking;Industries","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Lammle",NA,"Understanding Cisco Networking Technologies, Volume 1: Exam 200-301","","2020","","","287","316","This chapter covers several types of connections, technologies, and devices used in today's WANs. There are several reasons why WANs are necessary in corporate environments today. LAN technologies provide solid speeds‐10/40/100Gbps is now common‐at great prices, but these solutions can only work well in relatively small geographic areas. A major distinction between a WAN and a LAN is that while you generally own a LAN infrastructure, you usually lease a WAN infrastructure from a service provider. Modern technologies sometimes blur this characteristic somewhat, but this factor still fits neatly into the context of Cisco's exam objectives. A physical topology describes the physical layout of the network, in contrast to logical topologies, which describe the path a signal takes through the physical topology. WAN serial connectors use serial transmission, which takes place 1 bit at a time over a single channel. Older Cisco routers have used a proprietary 60‐pin serial connector that you have to get from Cisco or a provider of Cisco equipment. Cisco also has a new, smaller proprietary serial connection that's about one‐tenth the size of the 60‐pin basic serial cable called the smart‐serial, but you'll need to verify you have the right type of interface on your router before using it.","","9781119659068","10.1002/9781119659082.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823259.pdf&bkn=9820869&pdfType=chapter","","Topology;Network topology;Wide area networks;Local area networks;Costs;Redundancy;Ethernet","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Organization and description of data is studied under descriptive statistics, whereas analysis of data and making predictions based on it is dealt with in inferential statistics. The basic concepts of statistics are used to develop different methods for inference. The generalized linear models include techniques such as regression, ANOVA, log‐linear models, analysis of survival data, and so on, whereas specialized methods such as multivariate analysis of variance and random effect models are also used. Not all methods can be applied to all data sets, and suitability of a model depends upon the type of data. Predictions made using statistical inference can be prone to errors, and it is important to identify the sources of error and use preventive techniques. The study of error helps minimize them in not only conventional statistical methods, but also in neural networks and other machine learning methods.In this chapter, the basic concepts of probability are first introduced. The various techniques of descriptive and inferential statistics, their types, and applications are then discussed. Various commonly used methods have been introduced along with suitable examples. Types of errors that can arise in the application of statistical methods are discussed and analyzed with examples. The chapter intends to give fellow readers a firm footing in the statistical concepts that are widely used in the field on intelligent data analysis, which can then be used to develop state‐of‐the‐art methods for specific use cases.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821842.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Frequency measurement;Probability;Standards;Frequency conversion;Bars","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Reconnaissance is a pivotal step in performing intelligence gathering of a target host, network, web application, or connected product prior to actual exploitation. There are two separate approaches to performing reconnaissance: passive and active. Passive reconnaissance involves passively sniffing for data passing over the in‐vehicle network.

When reviewing the evidence in technological investigations, avoid placing total focus on digital evidence at the expense of understanding the personalities and motivations of the attackers involved. Looking at a suspect's behavior post‐offense is a very good way of corroborating the evidence investigators has gained throughout their investigation. Locating receipts or photos of high‐value purchases will provide dates of expenditure, which in turn can be linked to the time of the alleged offense. Depending upon the circumstances and investigators' legal authority, evidence of large expenditures can be traced back through bank accounts to find out where this money came from. At this time, bringing in an accountant with specialist skills in financial investigations and/or a fraud examiner will provide the cybercrime investigator valuable support.","","9781119596325","10.1002/9781119596318.ch17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821653.pdf&bkn=9820837&pdfType=chapter","","Data breach;Standards;Law;Computers;Solids;Personnel;Jacobian matrices","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Additionally, a subset of capabilities of MFA is available for Office 365 licensed users‐i.e., it can be used around Office 365 services. Global Administrators in Azure AD also can use Azure AD MFA for admin‐specific activities.

Fuchs",NA; NA,"CompTIA Cloud Essentials+ Study Guide: Exam CLO-002","","2020","","","163","214","This chapter explains the aspects of operating within the cloud and DevOps in cloud environments. Most of the major cloud service providers (CSPs) offer management tools that fall into one of three categories: Management console (web), Command‐line interface (CLI) and Software development kits (SDKs). The interesting and important thing to keep in mind when using any of these management options is that most management operations ultimately make an application programming interface (API) call to perform the work. When you use the web management console to start an instance, it is the web application that makes an API call to the backend to do the work. Operating within the cloud introduces new concepts and terminology because of the scale that CSPs can operate in. This scale was available only to larger enterprises, but now individuals and smaller organizations can benefit from a CSP's global infrastructure.Data is going to be your most valuable asset in the cloud. Data comes in many different forms, from structured data like databases to unstructured data like files and objects.DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.

"What is the Concept of Humanities in Francophone Digital Humanities?","C. Magis",NA,"Digitalization of Society and Socio-political Issues 2: Digital, Information, and Research","","2020","","","169","179","Digital Humanities (DH) could potentially be the place for radical critical reflection on the very role of theory in the digital age, following the Frankfurt School's Critical Theory project. However, it seems that it is not the direction that is currently being taken in Francophone discussions, while debates, particularly within information and communication sciences, are more concerned with the second term of the phrase than with the first. The historical survival of an idealistic temptation is just as problematic as mechanistic empiricism (whether or not it is helped by digital tools). It is important to embrace the narrow line of “equal distance from the horrors of unconceptual empiricism and theoricism which lacks the administration of proof”, but with the knowledge that, in the current debates around DH, it is the former that presents the biggest risk.","","9781119694823","10.1002/9781119694885.ch15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821925.pdf&bkn=9820887&pdfType=chapter","","Humanities;Training;Production;Social sciences;Interviews;Integrated circuits;Media","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

As one might imagine, the list of US and international laws, regulations, and standards is quite lengthy and complex. The global economy spans multiple continents, many nation‐states, and government entities. From the Asia Pacific region to Australia and New Zealand, the European Union (EU), Eastern Bloc countries, and South America, a wide range of laws, regulations, and rules govern both data privacy and security safeguards. Criminal law involves all legal matters where the government is in conflict with any person, group, or organization that violates statutes. Statutes (state and federal) are legislated by lawmakers. They are rules that define conduct prohibited by the government and are designed to provide for the safety and well‐being of the public. One example is traffic laws, which when broken result in court appearances, fines, and so on. Other more obvious examples are laws involving robbery, theft, and murder. State laws are those that we typically think of on a day‐to‐day basis. Speed limits, state tax laws, the criminal code, and so on are all examples of laws enacted by a state legislature as opposed to those enacted at the national or federal level.","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822490.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Law;Contracts;Cloud computing;Regulation;Criminal law;Privacy;Legislation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

If security engineering has a core theme, it may be the study of security protocols. In this chapter, the author gives many examples of how protocols fail. It considers the kinds of technical attack we have to block when designing protocols that operate between one machine and another. The first use of challenge‐response authentication protocols was probably in the military, with ‘identify‐friend‐or‐foe’ systems. The examples of security protocols are mostly about authenticating a principal's name, or application data such as the impulses driving a taximeter. There is one further class of authentication protocols that is very important – the protocols used to manage cryptographic keys. Formal methods can be an excellent way of finding bugs in security protocol designs as they force the designer to make everything explicit and thus confront difficult design choices that might otherwise be fudged.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821929.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Protocols;Automobiles;Security;Cryptography;Codes;Passwords;Meters","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

If the in‐house mechanisms for resolving disputes fail, the next option open to data subjects would be approaching the SA. It is evident that any GDPR complaint or suit can be filed by the data subject directly or through a legal representative/attorney to represent their rights before the SA/court. Two scenarios for exercising judicial remedies against the SA are for appeal and delay.

The analysis of histogram data can be performed by using an appropriate dissimilarity measure: the L2 ‐Wasserstein distance. The transformation of data in sequences of histograms has required an extension of the variogram model. As in the classic ordinary kriging for geostatistical data, the predictor is a weighted average of sample values which uses the variogram to account for the variability between the samples and the variances between the samples and the point to estimate. The evaluation of the performance on simulated and real data has confirmed that where the hypotheses on the data are satisfied, strategy is effective both in monitoring the spatial dependence and in predicting the data distribution.","","9781119695103","10.1002/9781119695110.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822820.pdf&bkn=9820889&pdfType=chapter","","Histograms;IEEE Sections;Monitoring;Data mining;Prototypes;Proposals;Position measurement","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It shows how to interrogate a name server, find vulnerabilities in the software running on these servers, and, ultimately, exploit them. The way in which DNS has been designed and implemented can be exploited to perform distributed denial‐of‐service attacks, where the power of multiple machines can be harnessed to send large amounts of traffic to a single server, rendering it useless and unable to function correctly. DNS uses a hierarchy both to store information and to serve that information when requested. One way to think about the DNS hierarchy is to compare it to the file structure on a UNIX‐like computer. The data stored within DNS is known as resource records, and they are generally stored in a flat‐file format.

Various 2016 reports all point towards a shift within advertising, from traditional media to digital social media and search engines (Google). Some see digital social media as a vehicle for democratizing access to the public sphere. This chapter aims to measure traffic from a given perspective and focuses on digital social media for text sharing (Facebook, Twitter), to which YouTube is added, because of its wide reach, as well as email. The website hosted the reference text (the unpublished letter) and the research protocol, and gave access to the main digital social media (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube). To help them plan their presence strategy on social and digital media, they used three “good practice” guides. The syncretism of these documents led them to develop a four‐step approach: observation and positioning; integration into digital social media; presence; and measurement and follow‐up.","","9781119694823","10.1002/9781119694885.ch10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823110.pdf&bkn=9820887&pdfType=chapter","","Social networking (online);Media;Internet;Monitoring;Video on demand;Electronic mail;Blogs","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Anderson",NA,"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems","","2020","","","375","403","Inference control goes back to the 1920s when economic data were compiled in ways that masked the contribution of individual firms, but it was first studied systematically in the context of census data. An advance in theory came in 2006, when Cynthia Dwork and colleagues developed the theory of differential privacy, which quantifies the extent to which inferences can be prevented by limiting queries and adding noise, enabling us to add noise where it's needed. Strategic mechanisms like differential privacy focus on keeping the anonymity set large enough, while many tactical mechanisms assess the risk that people with access to some application will overlap readers' privacy set. Dealing with database reconstruction piecemeal is hard; that's the value of differential privacy. The differential‐privacy approach will protect everyone, while the old system only protected people who were swapped, and it has to be done all at once.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822591.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Remuneration;Databases;Data privacy;Privacy;Government;Search engines;Physics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter presents a novel‐weighted multi‐table clustering method that is able to partition objects by simultaneously adapting the weight of the variables and the weights of the tables or views. The proposed method has two disadvantages: there is no theoretical guarantee that the globally optimal partition is found and the appropriate number of clusters should be given by the user. Research about the clustering of multiple tables or datasets was done extensively, resulting in the emergence of different algorithms. The chapter considers two data sets: Iris plant data set and multi‐features dataset. In data analysis, variables used to describe the objects are single‐valued. The weight of the variable determines its influence in the classification.","","9781119695103","10.1002/9781119695110.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822290.pdf&bkn=9820889&pdfType=chapter","","Clustering algorithms;XML;Weight measurement;Web pages;Unsupervised learning;Tuning;Social networking (online)","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Sadiqui","Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Morocco","Computer Network Security","","2020","","","41","66","This chapter focuses on the implementation of network time protocol (NTP), the syslog protocol, and the simple network management protocol (SNMP). The management plane includes the traffic of network surveillance protocols, in this case the syslog and the SNMP protocols. The NTP makes it possible to synchronize the local clock of a component of the computer network with that of a reference server. The syslog protocol is used to collect log messages generated by a device or an application. These messages may sometimes be the only way of clarifying why some equipment malfunctioned. The SNMP allows to monitor, diagnose, and manage network equipment remotely. The SNMP detects problems on the network and manages exceptional events (loss of a network link, an equipment suddenly ceasing to function etc.). Many software packages use SNMP to produce graphs that depict the evolution of network traffic or computer systems.","","9781119706748","10.1002/9781119706762.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823137.pdf&bkn=9820894&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Protocols;Synchronization;Computer networks;Passwords;Cryptography;Codes","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer Study Guide","","2020","","","165","190","This chapter describes how to design databases for reliability, scalability, and availability. Cloud Bigtable is a nonrelational database based on a sparse three‐dimensional map. The three dimensions are rows, columns, and cells. By understanding this 3D map structure, you will be able to figure out the best way to design Cloud Bigtable schemas and tables to meet scalability, availability, and reliability requirements. The 3D map structure of Cloud Bigtable lends itself to distributed implementations. Cloud Bigtable databases are deployed on a set of resources known as an instance. (This is not the same thing as a virtual machine (VM) instance in Compute Engine.) An instance consists of a set of nodes, which are virtual machines, as well as a set of sorted string tables and log data that is stored in Google's Colossus filesystem. Cloud Bigtable replication allows you to keep multiple copies of your data in multiple regions or multiple zones. This approach can improve availability and durability. You can also take advantage of replicated data to distribute workloads across multiple clusters.","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822415.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Databases;Scalability;Reliability;Reliability engineering;Metadata;Virtual machining","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It begins by discussing cryptography basics, paying particular attention to how most of today's public key encryption schemes provide protection. Cryptography basics cover digital encryption, authentication, and integrity hashing basics. The major cryptographic functions of symmetric ciphers, asymmetric ciphers, and integrity hashing functions provide a wide range of services to the computer world, and by extension, to the real world. Common cryptographic uses include the following: encryption, authentication and digital signing. Quantum computers are capable of breaking many forms of traditional cryptography because of their inherent quantum properties coupled with quantum algorithms, which take advantage of those properties and shortcut the math. Quantum computers and quantum properties cannot magically break every known cryptography cipher. They can break only ciphers that rely on particular functions that are susceptible to quantum properties and quantum algorithms for their protections.","","9781119618218","10.1002/9781119618232.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822672.pdf&bkn=9820848&pdfType=chapter","","Ciphers;Cryptography;Encryption;Computers;Quantum computing;Standards;Public key","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Traditional infosec is based on the premise of blue teaming and red teaming (although not all companies have, or necessarily require, either in their strictest form). Blue teams are the “white‐hat” defenders—those who work on a systems‐oriented approach, performing analyses of information systems to ensure security, identify security flaws, verify the effectiveness of security measures, and make sure that all security measures continue to be effective after implementation. Red teams use the same tools and techniques that real, malicious hackers use. In purple teaming, a team of experts takes on the role of both the red team and the blue team with the intention of anticipating attacks and addressing vulnerabilities and weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious third parties.","","9781119561484","10.1002/9781119561507.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821693.pdf&bkn=9820824&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Companies;Computer hacking;Computer crime;Organizations;Computers;General Data Protection Regulation","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Selikoff","CodeRanch; Selikoff Solutions, LLC","OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Programmer I Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-815","","2020","","","1","34","This chapter covers the fundamentals of Java. The Java Development Kit (JDK) contains the minimum software you need to do Java development. Key pieces include the compiler (javac), which converts .java files to .class files, and the launcher java, which creates the virtual machine and executes the program. The JDK also contains other tools including the archiver (jar) command, which can package files together, and the API documentation (javadoc) command for generating documentation. The javac program generates instructions in a special format that the java command can run called bytecode. Then java launches the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) before running the code. The JVM knows how to run bytecode on the actual machine it is on. In Java programs, classes are the basic building blocks. When defining a class, you describe all the parts and characteristics of one of those building blocks. To use most classes, you have to create objects. An object is a runtime instance of a class in memory. An object is often referred to as an instance since it represents a single representation of the class. All the various objects of all the different classes represent the state of your program. A reference is a variable that points to an object.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822109.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Codes;Virtual machining;Software;C++ languages;Encapsulation;Animals","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The methodology is based on in‐depth biographical interviews with 20 journalists, including eight French‐speaking Canadians and 12 French nationals. The statements of online journalists reveal that innovation is a very present category in the way interviewees conceive their practices, the labor market and even the “future” of journalism. The relationship with innovation and digital technology is also used to explain certain career choices. Some respondents adopted enthusiastic positions towards digital technology, and others stated mistrust, or even resistance, with regard to the introduction of innovations in journalistic practices. From the point of view of professional sociology, the status of “digital journalism” itself therefore refers to very diverse professional segments, which also present significant variations in ideologies, practices and career plans.","","9781119694823","10.1002/9781119694885.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821533.pdf&bkn=9820887&pdfType=chapter","","Engineering profession;Technological innovation;Interviews;Journalism;Urban areas;Sociology;Media","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

"Understanding security policies","C. Panek",NA,"Security Fundamentals","","2020","","","111","132","The chapter discusses what goes into creating a strong password and how to configure password settings to ensure that passwords in an environment stay secure. There are a variety of configuration settings that can be used on systems to ensure that users are required to set and maintain strong passwords. As hard as it can be to believe, left to their own devices, many users will still select weak passwords when securing their accounts. With user education and system controls, users can reduce the risk of weak passwords compromising their applications. A basic component of an information security program is ensuring that employees select and use strong passwords. The strength of a password can be determined by examining the length, complexity, and randomness of the password. Microsoft provides several controls that can be used to ensure the security associated with passwords is maintained. Password complexity deals with the characters used to make up the password. Microsoft's password complexity settings, when enabled, require characters from three of these categories by default on domain controllers, and the domain can be configured to require this setting for all passwords. The password complexity settings can be either enabled or disabled. There are no additional configurations available.","","9781119650706","10.1002/9781119650737.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822359.pdf&bkn=9820863&pdfType=chapter","","Passwords;Complexity theory;History;Information security;Operating systems;Education;Voice mail","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"From Narratives to Systems","E. Schmitt",NA,"Big Data: An Art of Decision Making","","2020","","","165","185","This chapter discusses the narrative configuration and the system configuration which represents the two ends of the spectrum for big data analysis projects. The narrative configuration is a matter of craftsmanship and innovation. It is a matter of retracing through the narrative a new articulation between an epistemic project and analyzed data, between hypotheses or intentions of knowledge, and a way of testing them. The system configuration consists of producing a nonlinear computational form, typically application software, which is the result of a software design and engineering process, and whose outcome is intended to function autonomously. One of the major concerns of software engineering with respect to the contributions of data sciences is that of scale or scalability. A good part of the technologies marketed with the label “big data” are used to respond to the problem of carrying out a common computational operation.","","9781119777007","10.1002/9781119777014.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822799.pdf&bkn=9820910&pdfType=chapter","","Big Data;Technological innovation;Data analysis;Creativity;Shape;Production;Cultural differences","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Distributed Systems","R. Anderson",NA,"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems","","2020","","","243","273","Many secure distributed systems have incurred large costs, or developed serious vulnerabilities, because their designers ignored the basics of how to build (and how not to build) distributed systems. Systems are becoming ever more concurrent for a number of reasons. Concurrency control in the real world is also a security issue. Failure recovery is often the most important aspect of security engineering, yet it is one of the most neglected. Fault tolerance and failure recovery are often the core of the security engineer's job. Naming is a minor if troublesome aspect of ordinary distributed systems, but it becomes surprisingly hard in security engineering. Names exist in contexts, and naming the principals in secure systems is becoming ever more important and difficult. Many problems arise when merging two systems that use naming schemes that are incompatible. Sometimes this can even happen by accident.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821835.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Concurrent computing;Government;Credit cards;Authorization;Servers;Protocols;Costs","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

This chapter also explains how to run them and how to discover existing modules. When writing code for the exam, you generally see small classes. After all, exam questions have to fit on a single screen! When you work on real programs, they are much bigger. A real project will consist of hundreds or thousands of classes grouped into packages. These packages are grouped into Java archive (JAR) files. A JAR is a zip file with some extra information, and the extension is .jar. In addition to code written by your team, most applications also use code written by others. Open source is software with the code supplied and is often free to use. Java has a vibrant open‐source software (OSS) community, and those libraries are also supplied as JAR files. For example, there are libraries to read files, connect to a database, and much more. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS) was introduced in Java 9 to group code at a higher level and tries to solve the problems that Java has been plagued with since the beginning. The main purpose of a module is to provide groups of related packages to offer a particular set of functionality to developers.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823294.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Java;Codes;Runtime;Libraries;Access control;Animals;Testing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

However, some obstacles have been found, limiting the application of ASD to such a domain. This chapter focuses on one such challenges, the degradation of the system architecture over time, which is called, in literature, Architectural Technical Debt (ATD). Software engineering is an individual activity and the causes for ATD accumulation can be related to suboptimal decision taken by individual employees. New employees as well are more subjected to accumulating ATD due to the natural noncomplete understanding of the architecture and patterns. The chapter summarizes the causes, trends, consequences, and possible solutions related to the management of ATD. The results are all based on a strong collaboration with several software‐intensive systems industries located in northern Europe and, consequently, relevant to all Industry 4.0 companies.","","9781119513940","10.1002/9781119513957.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822620.pdf&bkn=9820812&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Computer architecture;Software;Systems architecture;Embedded systems;Teamwork;Systematics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Blockchains are used in two main categories of IT solutions, either public permissionless or private enterprise permissioned blockchains. The chapter covers enterprise blockchain integration, scalability, and security. The structure and the components of the blockchain network will be different and will vary between blockchain solutions. When it comes to architecting solutions for blockchains for an enterprise, it is important to understand how enterprise architectures have been approached. Having a workflow can certainly provide significant instructions to help facilitate the design of a blockchain solution. Blockchain technology has the core characteristics of decentralization, accountability, and security. These characteristics are important to understand when designing a blockchain service. The chapter highlights specifics as to how four blockchain ledgers address the data structure in more detail.

This chapter examines how the company operates in the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) regime and how it has complied. GDPR investigations into FB fall under the authority of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who has been assigned as a Lead Supervisory Authority to investigate the company's behavior‐monitoring and data‐collection practices. The steady increase of data‐collection capabilities of the service will likely cause more confusion when fulfilling the information obligation under GDPR. The FB Group's primary basis for appeal is the regulatory ""incompetence"" of the German antitrust authority to order GDPR‐based measures on the company's personal data processing. It is important to note that special data protections on the website are minimal as FB utilizes a clever GDPR loophole that allows it to access the information without specific linkage to a user.","","9781119594253","10.1002/9781119594307.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822829.pdf&bkn=9820836&pdfType=chapter","","Companies;Social networking (online);Law;Regulators;Regulation;Internet;Data protection","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Because the computer is connected to an organization's network, it is important to protect the client computer. You would like to keep your users productive rather than spend time fixing their computers. After working with computers for a while, you begin to realize that protecting a client computer can become quite complicated when trying to maintain its Windows operating system, its many applications, and the various network applications and services required to make it a productive tool in the face of all the malicious malware to which it's currently exposed. Malicious software, sometimes called malware, is software designed to infiltrate and adversely affect a computer system without the owner's informed consent.

"Fog Computing","A. Ioualalen",NA,"Data Lakes","","2020","","","171","186","The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the concept of data acquisition into the data lake environment, and for some data lakes, volume limits could be reached in the near future. One main characteristic of fog computing is the sharing of data ingestion steps between the sensors which produce data, and the data lake which consumes data. This chapter explains the concept of fog computing and the associated challenges and then discusses the different options to be taken into account when dealing with a data lake. The main origin of the volume paradox comes from the fact that every communicating object is speaking freely and directly to potentially the whole network. Fog, cloud and edge computing may appear similar, but they are in fact different layers of the IoT. Most enterprises are familiar with cloud computing, which is now a de facto standard in many industries.","","9781119720423","10.1002/9781119720430.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821517.pdf&bkn=9820901&pdfType=chapter","","Automobiles;Cloud computing;Big Data applications;Roads;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Production facilities","","","","1","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The chapter presents a review of the literature of statistical process monitoring articles, which are based on SVM models. It also presents the D‐SVM chart introduced by He et al. and aims to test its performance on a real data set, downloaded from the UCI machine learning repository. As far as the D‐SVM chart is concerned, it needs a way of optimization for its parameters and maybe some method to better project the decision values to probabilities of out of control. The chapter proposes a new method that gives better results.

"Concepts and Discourses","D. Ventre",NA,"Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Cyber Defence","","2020","","","45","104","Constructivist theories give discourse a central place in the analysis of international relations. Artificial intelligence (AI) is subject to a multitude of definitions. Understanding or defining “artificial” on the one hand and “intelligence” on the other hand does not fully define “AI”. The lack of consensus on the definitions of the two concepts of intelligence, on the one hand, and artificiality, on the other hand, makes the task of defining their combination in the expression “AI” more difficult. AI aims to reproduce in the computer, through software, human capacities or functions. Expert systems are one of the key concepts in the history of AI. The applications of expert systems have been numerous since the 1970s: in 1972, for example, in the field of medicine, the MYCIN system was developed to identify the organisms responsible for an infection based on patients’ symptoms; in the military field, expert systems have provided decision support tools, etc.","","9781119788171","10.1002/9781119788195.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821926.pdf&bkn=9820917&pdfType=chapter","","Artificial intelligence;Computer security;Technological innovation;Task analysis;International relations;Informatics;Economics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It gives an answer so many other quantum computing experts want to avoid: exactly when is the quantum crypto break happen? There are four possible broad time periods when the quantum crypto break is going to happen: it is already happened, but we do not know about it; it will happen in the next few years; it will not happen in the next few years, but eventually will; or it will never happen. If history can be used as a guide, then the most likely breakout scenario will be one where the nation‐states will be the first entities to use large‐scale quantum computing. Governments might even create laws that prevent quantum computing manufacturers from allowing their computers to be used to crack traditional public key crypto.","","9781119618218","10.1002/9781119618232.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823198.pdf&bkn=9820848&pdfType=chapter","","Quantum computing;Qubit;Quantum mechanics;Cryptography;Error correction;Quantum algorithm;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

In this chapter, the author discusses six examples of cryptographic engineering – full disk encryption, the Signal protocol, The Onion Router (Tor), hardware security modules (HSMs), enclaves and blockchains. Tor's cryptographic and software design has evolved over 20 years in the face of a variety of threats and abuse, and it is now used as a component in many applications. In the cryptocurrency industry, HSMs are used to protect keys that could sign away substantial assets. A number of people have proposed electronic voting systems based on blockchains because they're supposedly immutable and readers can build functionality on them using crypto. The idea that blockchains can solve the problems of elections makes the experienced security engineer despair.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822032.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Cryptography;Encryption;Protocols;Hardware;Passwords;Operating systems;Switches","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Assurance can be measured roughly by whether capable motivated people have beat up on the system enough. In the security engineering of a decade ago, we often talked of assurance in terms of evaluation, which was about how readers assembled the evidence to convince their boss, clients, and a jury, that it did indeed work. Things often fail because one principal carries the cost of protection while another carries the risk of failure. Third‐party evaluation schemes such as the Common Criteria were supposed to make these risks more transparent and mitigate them, but ended up acting as a liability shield – particularly in the public sector and in regulated industries such as banking. The chapter looks at dependability metrics from the viewpoints of failure analysis, bug tracking, cross‐product dependencies, open‐source software and the development team.","","9781119642831","10.1002/9781119644682.ch28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823192.pdf&bkn=9820859&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Safety;Industries;Standards;Usability;Testing;Software","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Threat hunting provides a real‐world application of the skills used during incident response to not only provide practice to the people involved, but also to test and tune the technologies employed in his/her environment.

Way for the media/DSN to build its temporality is to distance itself from the media agenda, which corresponds to a social, collective time, built by the classical media and their resonances. DSNs feel and behave like media by building editorial space and time, controlling access to audiences, and establishing publication rules and formats without producing any content. At the heart of questioning is the type of relationships that are being built between news producing media and DSNs. The different point of attention concerns the difficulty of identifying a media territory, as it is so logical in terms of fragment and fragmentation.","","9781119694823","10.1002/9781119694885.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822996.pdf&bkn=9820887&pdfType=chapter","","Media;Social networking (online);Production;Multimedia Web sites;TV;Mobile handsets;Semiotics","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Sullivan",NA,"Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer Study Guide","","2020","","","139","164","This chapter introduces several key topics of security and compliance, including: Identity and access management; Data security, including encryption and key management; Data loss prevention; Compliance. Cloud IAM is Google Cloud's fine‐grained identity and access management service that is used to control which users can perform operations on resources within GCP. Cloud IAM uses the concept of roles, which are collections of permissions that can be assigned to identities. Permissions are granted to roles, and then individuals can be assigned multiple roles to gain these permissions. Cloud IAM provides a large number of roles tuned to common use cases, such as server administrators or database operators. Along with roles, additional attributes about resources or identities, such as IP address and date and time, can be considered when making access control decisions; this is known as context‐aware access. Predefined roles are generally associated with a GCP service, such as App Engine or BigQuery, and a set of related activities, such as editing data in a database or deploying an application to App Engine. The naming convention for roles is to start the role name with roles/ followed by a string that identifies the service, such as appengine; followed by the type of entity to which the role applies, such as instance or table; followed by an operation, such as get, list, or create.","","9781119618447","10.1002/9781119618461.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822686.pdf&bkn=9820850&pdfType=chapter","","Access control;Internet;Engines;Encryption;Databases;Data security;Testing","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

It discusses the numerous framework options, such as VAST, PASTA, and the Microsoft STRIDE model that can be used to perform threat modeling. Threat modeling consists of several steps: (1) understanding the security requirements by defining the boundaries of the security problem, external dependencies, and security controls in the system; (2) creating an asset inventory and identifying the roles of those assets and how they interact; (3) identifying the trust boundaries between those assets; (4) identifying the threats that are applicable to the assets; (5) identifying the attacks that can be used to realize each threat; and (6) planning and implementing the security controls to mitigate the threats. The overall goal is to understand the threats affecting the asset(s) to identify the mitigation strategies to lower the likelihood of their successful occurrence.","","9781119491781","10.1002/9781119491774.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822633.pdf&bkn=9820810&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Registers;Object recognition;Automobiles;Data models;Risk management;Cross-site scripting","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"
"Intelligent Data Analysis Using Hadoop Cluster – Inspired MapReduce Framework and Association Rule Mining on Educational Domain","P. Guleria; M. Sood","Department of Computer Science, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla, India; Department of Computer Science, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla, India","Intelligent Data Analysis: From Data Gathering to Data Comprehension","","2020","","","137","156","With the growing rate of data increases in the education field in recent years, there is a need for intelligent data analytics (IDA), so that academic data can be used effectively to improve learning. Educational data mining and learning analytics are the fields of IDA that play important roles in the intelligent analysis of educational data. One of the real challenges being faced by students and institutions alike is ensuring the quality of their education. An equally important factor related to the quality of education is the performance of students in the higher education system. It is not difficult to comprehend that the quality of decisions that the students make about their choices while selecting their courses and areas of specializations is of grave concern here. In the absence of support systems, the students and the teachers/mentors fall short in making the right decisions at the right time for furthering their cherished career paths. Therefore, the authors felt a need to address the issue of this kind of support system by proposing a system that can guide the student to choose, and to focus on, the right course(s) based on their personal preferences. For this purpose, a system has been envisaged by blending the concepts of data mining and classification with those of big data. In this chapter, a methodology using MapReduce framework and association rule mining is proposed for deriving the right blend of courses for students to pursue appropriate courses/ training and to enhance their career prospects. For students, it will lead to a rational and justifiable decision‐making support process from where they can give shape to their dream careers. It will also save the gullible students and parents from being misguided by unscrupulous players to opt for the courses not suitable/appropriate for the students, or even those courses/ training that are contrary to their preferences. The results of the experimentation have shown that the best rules can be derived from this system in order to support the decision‐making process by the students with a high degree of confidence.","","9781119544449","10.1002/9781119544487.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821837.pdf&bkn=9820815&pdfType=chapter","","Engines;Artificial intelligence;Semantics;Neural networks;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Education","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Many of the techniques evolved to defeat enemy radars, including various kinds of decoys and jamming, have interesting parallels in the new ‘information warfare’ world of fake news, troll farms and postmodern propaganda. This chapter discusses the communications system issues first, as they are the most self‐contained, then the sensors and associated jammers, and finally other devices such as electromagnetic pulse generators. Those aspects of electronic warfare that have to do with target acquisition and weapon guidance are where the arts of jamming and deception have been most highly developed.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods. An abstract method is a method d that does not define an implementation when it is declared. Both abstract classes and abstract methods are denoted with the abstract modifier. An abstract method is one that does not include a body when it is declared. An abstract method may be placed inside an abstract class or interface. Next, an abstract method can be overridden with another abstract declaration or a concrete implementation, provided the rules for overriding methods are followed. The first concrete class must implement all of the inherited abstract methods, whether they are inherited from an abstract class or interface. An interface is a special type of abstract structure that primarily contains abstract methods and constant variables. Interfaces include implicit modifiers, which are modifiers that the compiler will automatically apply to the interface declaration. For the 1Z0‐815 exam, you should know which modifiers are assumed in interfaces and be able to spot potential conflicts. When you prepare for the 1Z0‐816 exam, you will study the four additional non‐abstract methods that interfaces now support. Finally, while the compiler can often prevent casting to unrelated types, it has limited ability to prevent invalid casts when working with interfaces.","","9781119584728","10.1002/9781119584773.ch9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821605.pdf&bkn=9820834&pdfType=chapter","","Birds;Runtime;Codes;Writing;Standards;Software;Reactive power","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The chapter also presents new models for recommendation using social networks and discusses the problem of using attributes for enhancing model quality. There exist two main families of techniques to build RSs, depending on the available data: supervised model‐based and neighborhood‐based models. The latent‐space approach has been shown to perform best for rating prediction but neighborhood‐based techniques are best for Top‐N recommenders with implicit data. Social network analysis allowed us to derive hybrid RSs using attributes, predict a range of optimal N for Top‐N recommenders.

Security does not happen in stasis; we need information in order to conduct security activities in a proper and efficient manner. There are certain things we need to know in order to decide how we will handle risks within our organization. To protect our assets, we first have to know what they are. Everything owned or controlled by the organization can be considered an asset, and assets take many different forms. Assets can be tangible items, such as IT hardware, retail inventory, buildings, and vehicles. Assets can also be intangible, such as intellectual property, public perception, and goodwill with business partners and vendors. Personnel can also be considered assets, because of the skills, training, and productivity they provide to the organization. In traditional (non‐cloud) environments, we had bright‐line definitions of the organization's IT perimeter: everything inside the perimeter belonged to the organization, including data, hardware, and risk; everything outside was someone else's problem. We could even point at a specific location, a given cable leaving the facility or campus, and know that it, there, was the place where our control ended and someone else's began. We could armor our defenses at the interface between the internal environment and external factors, building up a demilitarized zone (DMZ).","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821833.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Cloud computing;Standards organizations;Personnel;Companies;Risk management;Costs","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

FL is an emerging collaborative machine learning technique that trains a model across multiple devices or servers holding private data samples without exchanging their data. The locally trained results are aggregated by a centralized server in a privacy-preserving way. However, there is an assumption where the centralized server is trustworthy, which is impractical. Fortunately, blockchain technology has opened a new era of data exchange among trustless strangers because of its decentralized architecture and cryptography-supported techniques. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the author proposes a novel design of a smart agent inspired by the smart contract concept. Specifically, based on the proposed smart agent, a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving and fair deep learning blockchain-FL framework is designed, where the agent network is consistent with the blockchain network and each smart agent is a participant in the FL task. During the whole training process, both the data and the model are not at the risk of leakage. Findings – A demonstration of the proposed architecture is designed to train a neural network. Finally, the implementation of the proposed architecture is conducted in the Ethereum development, showing the effectiveness and applicability of the design.

First of all, a concrete design of a smart agent model is proposed, inspired by the smart contract concept in blockchain. The smart agent is autonomous and is able to disseminate, verify the information and execute the supported protocols. Based on the proposed smart agent model, a new architecture composed by these agents is formed, which is a blockchain network. Then, a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving and smart agent blockchain-FL framework has been proposed, where a smart agent acts as both a peer in a blockchain network and a participant in a FL task at the same time.

Because crowd network is a large-scale, dynamic and diversified online deep interconnection, its most results cannot be observed in real world, and it cannot be carried out in accordance with traditional way, simulation is of great importance to put forward related research. To solve above problems, this paper aims to propose a simulation architecture based on the characteristics of crowd network and to verify the feasibility of this architecture through a simulation example. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts a data-driven architecture by deeply analyzing existing large-scale simulation architectures and proposes a novel reflective memory-based architecture for crowd network simulations. In this paper, the architecture is analyzed from three aspects: implementation framework, functional architecture and implementation architecture. The proposed architecture adopts a general structure to decouple related work in a harmonious way and gets support for reflection storage by connecting to different devices via reflection memory card. Several toolkits for system implementation are designed and connected by data-driven files (DDF), and these XML files constitute a persistent storage layer. To improve the credibility of simulations, VV&A (verification, validation and accreditation) is introduced into the architecture to verify the accuracy of simulation system executions. Findings – Implementation framework introduces the scenes, methods and toolkits involved in the whole simulation architecture construction process. Functional architecture adopts a general structure to decouple related work in a harmonious way. In the implementation architecture, several toolkits for system implementation are designed, which are connected by DDF, and these XML files constitute a persistent storage layer. Crowd network simulations obtain the support of reflective memory by connecting the reflective memory cards on different devices and connect the interfaces of relevant simulation software to complete the corresponding function call. Meanwhile, to improve the credibility of simulations, VV&A is introduced into the architecture to verify the accuracy of simulation system executions. Originality/value – This paper proposes a novel reflective memory-based architecture for crowd network simulations. Reflective memory is adopted as share memory within given simulation execution in this architecture; communication efficiency and capability have greatly improved by this share memory-based architecture.

The BF traits are indicators of personality and are said to be an effective predictor of study performance in various occupations. BF can be used in crowdsourcing to predict crowd workers' performance; however, it will be difficult to use in practice for two reasons like the time-and-effort issue and the bias issue. In this study, an empirical analysis is conducted on crowdsourcing to examine if TIPI-J can solve those issues. Design/methodology/approach – To investigate the issues, two tasks are posted on a crowdsourcing provider. Both TIPI-J and full version BF are conducted before and after selecting crowd workers. Structural validity and convergence validity are tested with correlation analysis between before (TIPI-J) and after (full version BF) data to examine the bias issue. Additionally, those correlations are compared with previous study and significances are examined. Findings – The correlations in “conscientiousness” is 0.45-0.50, respectively, compared with a previous study, those two correlations did not show significance. This indicates that no clear bias exists.

This form of interconnectedness has bolstered national economies, enhanced how governments interact with their citizens and how ordinary people connect with friends and family. However, this dependence has equally resulted to a high rise in vulnerability, threat and risk associated with more use of information and communication technology. Cyber-attacks that have the potential to disrupt or damage information system infrastructure are getting more complex with some level of sophistication. Traditional protection of information system infrastructure is no longer sufficient; systems have proven to be immune to failure or incidents. This paper aims to ensure that there is a continuous availability of services through a fail-safe proof. Design/methodology/approach – MYSQL replication technique was used to develop a model based on three-tier layers using the principle of network interdependency and the replication techniques. Tier 1 depicts a Telecom organization serving as service provider that provides internet service to Tier 2 organization – a Bank; Tier 3 is the financial App that can be used by bank staff and customers. The fail-safe mode integrated mechanism enables Tier 3 to continue to render its services in the event of an attack on Tier 1 such as DDoS without disruption. Findings – This technique succeeded in mitigating the loss of data if cyber incident occurred or reception of uninterrupted services is countered, which give rise to future master-to-master architecture. Research limitations/implications – The study conducted is limited to the design and development of a fail-safe system for interdependent networks or systems using MYSQL replication technique. Originality/value – In an interdependent environment such as the cyberspace, the sectors are interdependent for optimal results. The originality of the work ensures that there is availability of services which is sustained and that data integrity is assured using the fail-safe technique based on MySQL replication method.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-04-2018-0008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826684","Mitigation","Government;Web and internet services;Cyberspace;Data models;Telecommunications;Security;Telecommunication network reliability","computer network security;data integrity;Internet;SQL","interdependent environment;fail-safe technique;MySQL replication method;cyber environment;information systems;communication technology;cyber-attacks;information system infrastructure;MYSQL replication technique;three-tier layers;Tier 1 depicts;service provider;Internet service;Tier 2 organization;Tier 3;fail-safe mode integrated mechanism;cyber incident;uninterrupted services;fail-safe system;data integrity;DDoS;financial App","","","","25","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Design/methodology/approach – Interpreting user behavior from the probabilistic perspective of hidden variables is helpful to improve robustness and over-fitting problems. Constructing a recommendation network by variational inference can effectively solve the complex distribution calculation in the probabilistic recommendation model. Based on the aforementioned analysis, this paper uses variational auto-encoder to construct a generating network, which can restore user-rating data to solve the problem of poor robustness and over-fitting caused by large-scale data. Meanwhile, for the existing KL-vanishing problem in the variational inference deep learning model, this paper optimizes the model by the KL annealing and Free Bits methods. Findings – The effect of the basic model is considerably improved after using the KL annealing or Free Bits method to solve KL vanishing. The proposed models evidently perform worse than competitors on small data sets, such as MovieLens 1 M. By contrast, they have better effects on large data sets such as MovieLens 10 M and MovieLens 20 M. Originality/value – This paper presents the usage of the variational inference model for collaborative filtering recommendation and introduces the KL annealing and Free Bits methods to improve the basic model effect. Because the variational inference training denotes the probability distribution of the hidden vector, the problem of poor robustness and overfitting is alleviated. When the amount of data is relatively large in the actual application scenario, the probability distribution of the fitted actual data can better represent the user and the item. Therefore, using variational inference for collaborative filtering recommendation is of practical value.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-10-2019-0030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826663","Collaborative filtering;Probabilistic perspective;Variational inference;Variational auto-encoder;KL-vanishing problem","Training;Deep learning;Annealing;Collaborative filtering;Collaboration;Probabilistic logic;Robustness","collaborative filtering;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;recommender systems","fitted actual data;collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm;large-scale data;Interpreting user behavior;probabilistic perspective;over-fitting problems;recommendation network;complex distribution calculation;probabilistic recommendation model;variational auto-encoder;generating network;user-rating data;existing KL-vanishing problem;variational inference deep learning model;KL annealing;Free Bits method;KL vanishing;data sets;variational inference model;basic model effect;variational inference training;probability distribution","","","","23","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The paper proposes a conceptual architecture for the incorporation of crowdsourcing into the creation of ontologies. Design/methodology/approach – The research adopted the design science research approach characterised by cycles of “build” and “evaluate” until a refined artefact was established. Findings – Data from a case of a fruit fly platform demonstrates that online crowds can contribute to ontology enhancement if engaged in a structured manner that feeds into a defined ontology model. Research limitations/implications – The research contributes an architecture to the crowdsourcing body knowledge. The research also makes a methodological contribution for the development of ontologies using crowdsourcing. Practical implications – Creating ontologies is a demanding task and most ontologies are not exhaustive on the targeted domain knowledge. The proposed architecture provides a guiding structure for the engagement of online crowds in the creation and enhancement of domain ontologies.

In crowd science and technology, evolutionary phenomenon exists also among many agents in crowd network systems. This kind of phenomenon is named as crowd co-evolutionary, which cannot be easily studied by most existing methods for its nonlinearity. This paper aims to proposes a novel simulation framework for co-evolution to discover improvements and behaviors of intelligent agents in crowd network systems. Design/methodology/approach – This paper introduces a novel simulation framework for crowd co-evolutions. There are three roles and one scene in the crowd. The scene represented by a band-right to a ringless diagram. The three roles are unit, advisor and monitor. Units find path in the scene. Advisors give advice to units. Monitors supervise units' behavior in the scene. Building a network among these three kinds member, influencing individual relationships through information exchange, and finally enable the individual to find the optimal path in the scene. Findings – Through this simulation framework, one can record the behavior of an individual in a group, the reasons for the individual's behavior and the changes in the relationships of others in the group that cause the individual to do so. The speed at which an individual finds the optimal path can reflect the advantages and disadvantages of the relationship change function. Originality/value – The framework provides a new way to study the evolution of inter-individual relationships in crowd networks. This framework takes the first-person perspective of members of the crowd-sourced network as the starting point. Through this framework, the user can design relationship evolution methods and mathematical models for the members of different roles, so as to verify that the level of public intelligence of the crowd network is actually the essence of the rationality of the membership relationship.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-02-2020-0004","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1400105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826683","Relationship;Crowd co-evolution;Crowd network system;Framework for crowd co-evolution","Technological innovation;Design methodology;Decision making;Buildings;Mathematical models;Behavioral sciences;Intelligent agents","evolutionary computation;social sciences","optimal path;crowd-sourced network;relationship evolution methods;novel simulation framework;natural science;social science;crowd science;evolutionary phenomenon;crowd network systems;crowd co-evolutionary;intelligent agent behaviour;unit behavior;information exchange;relationship change function;mathematical models;public intelligence;membership relationship rationality","","3","","16","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

An inert atmosphere is required to prevent any hydrogen evolution as well as evaporation of the precursors. A black coloured silicon layer appeared on the substrate due to the reduction of the precursor. The resulting coating was characterized using XRD, EDX, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and stylus surface profiler. The EDX results illustrated the presence of elemental silicon in the film, along with some traces of silicon dioxide.

Often the performance of any flexible sensor depends on the extent and type of bending. In this direction, herein, we discuss a computational study based on a finite element method of two-dimensional bending of a flexible substrate to understand the stress development on the substrate. In this study, we have considered a 2mm thick sheet of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) polymer having a dimension of ($100\times 75\times 2$) mm as substrate material. Due to the outstanding mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of PEEK polymer, it is a very good candidate for the flexible electronic substrate. The mentioned substrate has been subjected to a tensile-compressive cyclic deformation of 20 mm from its axis. It was observed that the maximum surface stress of magnitude $9.07\times 10^{7}\ \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ is developed at the center of the substrate. However, the maximum stress developed at the edge is higher than that of the surface. Further, the fatigue analysis of the substrate shows that the substrate is stable for 9000 cycles of dynamic tensile or compressive bending. The computational analysis of bending in this case will be extremely helpful for the design and fabrication of flexible electronic sensors for various wearable applications.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776975","2D Bending;Flexible Electronics;Wearable Electronics;Fatigue Analysis","Performance evaluation;Wearable computers;Surface stress;Bending;Fatigue;Polymers;Flexible electronics","bending;compressive strength;deformation;fatigue;finite element analysis;polymers;sensors;stress analysis;tensile strength;wear","tensile-compressive cyclic deformation;wearable applications;two-dimensional bending;flexible electronic sensor;finite element method;flexible substrate;polyether ether ketone polymer;surface stress;fatigue","","","","25","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the external strain is not only responsible for electronic phase transition but also affects the magnetic ordering.

We have investigated the effect of BaTiO3 nanoparticle concentration on the frequency modulation properties of PDLCs. Initially, as the nanoparticle concentration increases, the required frequency for transmission modulation decreases. On further increasing nanoparticle concentration, the needed modulation frequency increases. For LC-based devices, the frequency modulation properties are usually explained by the variation of dielectric constant. The required frequency for modulation of properties shows a decrement in value from nearly 1 MHz (for pure sample) to 500 kHz (for 0.4 wt% BaTiO3 doped). Consequently, the BaTiO3 doped PDLC films are more suitable in optical modulators and PDLC hybrid electroluminescence for flexible electronic devices.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776981","UGC; DST; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776981","liquid crystal;polymer dispersed liquid crystal;frequency modulation;modulation frequency","Nanoparticles;Integrated optics;Frequency modulation;Optical polarization;Liquid crystal displays;Optical materials;Optical modulation","electroluminescence;ferroelectric materials;nanoparticles;permittivity;polymer dispersed liquid crystals;polymer films","frequency modulation;energy harvesting devices;nanoparticle concentration;transmission modulation;optical modulators;polymer dispersed liquid crystals;dielectric constant;ferroelectric nanoparticles;PDLC hybrid electroluminescence","","","","15","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various active-layer combinations for top and bottom sub-cells have been compared with respect to the maximum possible photocurrent density, parasitic absorption loss, reflection loss, and spectral overlap loss. The choice of materials was such that either their band gaps are close to ideal values or highest efficiency devices were reported using them. In the initial step for device optimization, the thickness of nonactive layer has been optimized to maximize the absorption in the low bandgap sub-cell. Subsequently, thicknesses of both the active layers were simultaneously varied to maximize and match the photocurrent densities ($J_{PH\vert Max}$) in two sub-cells. Within the several combinations optimized, we found that polymer - tin OIHP and all-polymer TSCs were the most promising ones, with $J_{PH\vert Max}$ values of 15.566 and 15.232 mA.cm−2 respectively. While the former had the lowest reflection loss (1.831 mA.cm−2) and spectral overlap loss (1.273 mA.cm−2) respectively, the later had the lowest parasitic absorption loss of 0.487 mA.cm−2. On the other hand, the all-OIHP TSCs analyzed here, were the least promising ones with reflection losses that could be as high as 18.18 mA.cm−2.

No separate passivation layer is used in either case. While the ALD films give highly conformal deposition, their performance depends upon factors such as precursors used and process temperature. Our solar cells fabricated using $\text{ALD}-\text{MoOx}$ could reach nearly 7% efficiency as compared to solar cells using $\text{TE}-\text{MoOx}$, which reached 10.13%. This difference is mainly attributed to the recombination factor, which is four orders of magnitude higher for $\text{ALD}-\text{MoOx}$ than $\text{TE}-\text{MoOx}$. The ideality factor deviated from unity for ALD-MoOx based diodes. The average carrier lifetime obtained for TE-MoOx films crossed 100 microseconds, while for $\text{ALD}-\text{MoOx}$, it is about 55 microseconds. These observations indicate ALD-$\text{MoOx}-\text{Si}$ interface is influenced by detrimental parameters like high density of defect states or surface contaminants or both, which are incorporated during ALD of $\text{MoOx}$ as all the other processing steps are common for both routes.

Hybrid sensors, consisting of external polarizers, have expensive manufacturing process. In this work, a bowtie nanoantenna with a gap size of 50nm, designed using an FDTD solver is illuminated with a light source of amplitude 1V/m and varying polarization to the nanoantenna axis. The electric field (EF) enhancement in the gap is 100 times larger in parallel polarization as compared to perpendicular polarization of incident light. The calculated absorption efficiency and polarization extinction ratio (PER) is found to be 80% and 21, respectively, in parallel polarization. This dependence paves the way for the application of nanoantenna as a polarization sensor.

Superjunction-LDMOS devices have shown to offer a low on-resistance while extending the off-state breakdown voltage by the virtue of increasing depletion area in the drift region. This makes them highly suitable in fast switching applications. While they display an outstanding OFF-state performance, these devices severely suffer from space charge modulation (SCM) leading to quasisaturation (QS) effects under high current conditions. This not only affects the operation of the device, but also degrades its safe operating area. Thus, designing such devices in order to meet the off-state requirements while mitigating SCM/QS effect is challenging. Design of a superjunction (SJ) implant in the drift region is reliant on the key process and geometrical variables such as doping, thickness, position and length of the implant, as well as, on the layout parameters like drift-doping and driftscaling. These device design parameters can be optimized individually or in combination of individual parameters in order to enhance the performance of the device. This work focuses on developing an elaborate understanding of the impact of geometrical parameters on the SCM/QS effects while proposing design guidelines aiming to mitigate these ON-state operation challenges and maximize the device performance.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776875","Laterally diffused MOS (LDMOS);superjunction;space charge modulation;quasi-saturation;design guideline","Performance evaluation;Design methodology;Layout;Modulation;Implants;Switches;Doping","MOSFET;power integrated circuits;semiconductor device breakdown;semiconductor device models;semiconductor doping;semiconductor junctions;space charge","on-state operation challenges;SCM/QS effect;driftscaling;quasisaturation effects;geometrical parameters;device design parameters;drift-doping;geometrical variables;superjunction implant;off-state requirements;safe operating area;high current conditions;off-state performance;fast switching applications;drift region;depletion area;off-state breakdown voltage;laterally diffused MOS transistors;smart power technologies;superjunction-LDMOS device;quasisaturation effect;geometrically dependent space charge modulation;device performance","","","","15","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The COMSOL Multiphysics tools and analytical solutions were used to analyze the contact behavior for impact sensors. The design validation using contact mechanics simulation of an acceleration sensor and an impact mass is reported. The electrical contact resistance of the latching switch is modelled using Hertzian contact mechanics theory.

The spread of SBH and ideality factor is in the range of 0.32 eV-1.05 eV and 7.16-1.48 respectively. The dependence of SBH and ideality factor points to the presence of in-homogeneities at Ni/AlGaN interface. Presence of these in-homogeneities at the metal/semiconductor interface leads to an inaccurate value of Richardson constant extracted using Richardson's plot. A Gaussian distribution of in-homogeneities at the interface is considered and included further in the standard schottky diode equation to obtain a modified Richardson's plot in order to extract a more precise value of Richardson constant for AlGaN epitaxial layer. The Schottky barrier height and Richardson constant obtained considering Gaussian distribution is 1.01 eV and 33.4 Acm−2K−2 respectively.

Frequency tuning and correction capability have become a stringent requirement to compensate for the deviation caused by the processes or temperature. The drift in thin-film properties and tuning ability is a concern in piezoelectric resonators. At the same time, the external electrostatic transducer is highly nonlinear. This study presents the damping and spring softening effects analysis of a fixed-fixed beam mechanical structure with internal electrostatic transduction. The gaps between the electrodes are filled with a high-k dielectric (Hf02) to improve the actuation and sensing port's coupling efficiency. The resonant frequency of the device is 0.53 MHz. The device has a coefficient of frequency of - 2115 ppm/V due to the electrostatic spring softening effect used for tuning and frequency correction of these devices, which is a significant advantage over piezoelectric devices. The results show an almost stable resonant frequency across the temperature range of −20°C to 140°C with a temperature coefficient of 0.1927 ppm/°C. The damping effects analysis helps to calculate the Quality factors of the device. The simulated Q for thermo-elastic damping is 34000, and anchor loss is 1346, which gives an overall Q of 1294.

Au, Ag, Cu, and Pt). The electrical conductance, the thermal conductance (electronic as well as phononic), and the thermopower are calculated to assess the thermoelectric efficiency. While the electronic transport is determined by using the non-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) approach based on the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the TranSIESTA module of SIESTA package, the phononic contribution is obtained using the Phonons module of ASE python package with ATOMISTICA as a calculator, together with the NEGF utility code, Phtrans. Our study predicts that the electronic thermal conductance rises in a non-linear fashion with temperature, while its phonon counterpart saturates to a characteristic constant after exhibiting an initial steep rise. Interestingly, the heat transport is found to be more in the zigzag direction. At room temperature, the relative phononic contribution to thermal conductance is seen to be the least for the Pt monolayer. The considered monolayers show only a small thermopower in the zero-biasing condition. However, it can be tuned by applying an external bias to achieve a value as large as about 1.05 mV/K in the Pt monolayer. Likewise, the Pt monolayer exhibits a maximum (about unity) thermoelectric figure of merit. As an interesting result, the predicted figure of merit is of the same order as for the noble metal atomic chains.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9777009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777009","monolayers;thermoelectric transport;NEGF;DFT","Heating systems;Electric potential;Temperature;Metals;Phonons;Reliability theory;Thermal conductivity","ab initio calculations;copper;density functional theory;electrical conductivity;gold;Green's function methods;monolayers;phonons;platinum;silver;thermal conductivity;thermoelectric power","thermoelectric transport;noble metals monolayers;first principles calculation;electrical conductance;thermopower;nonequilibrium Greens function;density functional theory;TranSIESTA module;SIESTA package;Phonons module;ASE python package;NEGF utility code;electronic thermal conductance;heat transport;noble metal atomic chains;Phtrans;figure of merit;Cu;Pt;Ag;Au","","","","29","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An efficient full adder circuit is crucial for arithmetic operations. This paper proposes a novel spintronic approximate full adder circuit based on an emerging magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) which offers partial non-volatility, low energy consumption, area efficiency, and speed over an exact adder. By performing the simulations, the effect of STT, SHE, and VCMA switching schemes are demonstrated on the performance of the adders.

We performed experiments on n-channel bulk FinFETs with two gate lengths, i.e. $\text{Lg}=30$ and 70nm. A set of these devices was subjected to hot-carrier stress, while another set kept virgin.

It is found that the polarization state of the PVDF-ZnO film plays an important role in the performance of the TENG. When the positively poled PVDF-ZnO film is used for the TENG, it gives more output voltage as compared to the unpoled film whereas when the film is negatively poled, it gives the least output voltage. The reason for getting different output voltage when the polarization state of the PVDF-ZnO film has been attributed to the change in the workfunction of PVDF with respect to PTFE. The present work clearly demonstrates the role of the polarization state of the contacting triboelectric material, which will be useful not only for the energy harvesting application but also in the field in which the triboelectric effect is used to control or power semiconducting devices.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776650","Department of Science and Technology(grant numbers:IF150974); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776650","Ferroelectric;triboelectric;PVDF;ZnO","Performance evaluation;X-ray scattering;Ferroelectric films;Conferences;Energy states;Energy harvesting;Triboelectricity","dielectric polarisation;II-VI semiconductors;nanogenerators;polymer films;semiconductor growth;semiconductor thin films;triboelectricity;wide band gap semiconductors;work function;zinc compounds","polarization state;triboelectric nanogenerator;output voltage;PVDF-ZnO film;work function;energy harvesting;ZnO","","","","13","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These properties can be enhanced by treating the layer with surfactants and co-solvents, respectively. In addition, annealing of the spin coated PEDOT:PSS films play a vital role as it influences the interface properties. Here we have compared two ways of annealing the spin coated PEDOT:PSS film to explore their impact on performance of Solar cells. The first method (Method A) involves a gradual increase in the annealing temperature of spin coated samples, while in the second method (Method B) the spin coated samples are directly subjected to annealing at a high set temperature.

A specific frequency laser strikes the analyte and gets absorbed. The absorbed energy gets released as heat and the accompanying temperature change causes the bimetal microcantilever to bend due to the mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). This deflection causes a change in quantum tunnelling current between the microcantilever tip and an electrode. The exponential dependence of tunnelling current on the deflection results in milli-Kelvin range temperature variation sensing capability. Microcantilever lengths between $10\mu\mathrm{m}$ to $50\mu\mathrm{m}$, widths between $1\mu\mathrm{m}$ to $5\mu\mathrm{m}$ and thicknesses between 100nm to 300nm are simulated for calculating the average thermal sensitivity over a 10mK range. Also, bimetal combinations of Aluminium-Silver, Aluminium-Chromium and Silver-Nickel are used to calculate the variations in the tunnelling current with change in metal combination for different concentrations of Ammonia.

The increasing component density in today's integrated circuits constricts the flexibility of designing a distant Conducting Guard Ring (CGR) around the inductor coil, which in turn, necessitates revisiting the existing inductance calculation formulations to attain the best accuracy. In this paper, we address the effect of Negative Mutual Inductance (NMI) caused by the CGR and propose a formula that accounts for the increase in NMI for distances between $5\ \mu\mathrm{m}\ \text{to}\ 100\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. NMI has been studied on our test inductor and the “proposed model” is numerically computed. The model is correlated with the HFSS simulations of DUT for various dCGR values (distance between outer most turn of the inductor and CGR) and the results when compared with the existing formulations reported in the literature, evidently display the prominent NMI effect on the effective inductance caused by the CGR. Therefore, proving that the effect of CGR cannot be overlooked for a dense circuit layout where dCGR is less than $50\ \mu \mathrm{m}$. At distances as small as $5 \mu \mathrm{m}$ – a common dCGR value in today's circuits, our formulation in an error of less than 6% when compared with the best of the reported formulations that returns a 32% error. The proposed model outperforms the best of the existing models for any dCGR up to $70\ \mu \mathrm{m}$, and thus, can be seen as an excellent and timely tool for the high-density SoC inductor designers.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776937","Negative Mutual Inductance;SoC inductor;inductance density","Inductance;Computational modeling;Conferences;RF signals;Layout;Power electronics;Numerical models","inductors;power electronics;system-on-chip","test inductor;dCGR values;CGR;existing formulations;prominent NMI effect;effective inductance;dense circuit layout;common dCGR value;reported formulations;high-density SoC inductor designers;accurate inductor model;system-on-chip planar inductors;vital components;miniaturized IoT systems;chip-level power electronics circuits;RF signal processing circuits;component density;integrated circuits;inductor coil;distant conducting guard ring;inductance calculation formulations;negative mutual inductance effect;distance 5.0 mum to 100.0 mum","","","","10","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Herein, PANi nanofibers were synthesized using a seeding method, using single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) seeds. Surface morphology of the thus synthesized nanofibers were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nanofibers were surface modified with 2% glutaraldehyde for facilitating probe-DNA immobilization, and the results of the same were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

Generally, the electron-phonon interaction changes with the temperature can lead to altering the effective phonon energy. This electron-phonon coupling is attributed to the considerable decrease in leakage current as temperature increases.

Tungsten disulfide has an intrinsic indirect bandgap of ∼1.3eV (bulk), which is tuned to a direct bandgap of ∼2.1 eV when the number of layers decreased to mono. An atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) approach was employed to realize WS2 on Si/SiO2 substrate with a 300 nm thick oxide layer (University Wafers). A custom-build 12-zone horizontal split furnace (Quazar Technologies Pvt. Ltd.) with solid-phase precursors (tungsten trioxide and elemental sulfur) were used. A set of growths were conducted with the WO3 zone heated to 900-1100°C with the Ar as carrier gas (0–300 sccm). Besides monolayer, spiral multilayer, pyramidal, nanoflower, and dendritic WS2 were also observed. The as-grown WS2 was characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope, Raman, and PL spectroscopy. The number of layers was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Labram) with a laser source of 514 nm and with much lesser power (1mW) to prevent any damage to the sample. The in-plane ($E_{2g}^{1}$) and out-of-plane ($A_{1g}$) peaks were observed at ∼352 cm−1 and ∼418 cm−1 confirming monolayer WS2. The $E_{2g}^{1}$ and $A_{1g}$ peaks shift with the increase in the number of layers (∼352 cm−1 and ∼419 cm−1 for bilayer WS2). The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 F SEM, 10–20 $k$ V) and optical imaging (Olympus BX53M) show the distribution of as-grown WS2 on the substrate.

The most advanced SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) technology (55-nm BiCMOS) demonstrates room temperature cut-off frequency ($f_{\mathrm{t}}$) and maximum oscillation frequency ($f_{\max}$) of 320 GHz and 370 GHz respectively. In this paper, we performed TCAD analysis to investigate the performance metrics, $f_{\mathrm{t}}$ and $f_{\max}$ of the SiGe HBT at different cryogenic temperatures. The calibrated Gummel characteristics reveals that a record DC current gain of $1.2\times 10^{4}$ is obtained at 77 K for $\mathrm{V}_{\text{BE}}=\mathrm{V}_{\text{CE}}=1.2\ \mathrm{V}$. The HBT device employs bandgap engineering by linearly varying the Ge concentration in the base region, which enhances the device performance. Both the bandgap engineering with linearly graded Germanium (Ge) profile (induces intrinsic drift field in the base) and the cryogenic operation of the HBT device results in enhancement of $f_{\mathrm{t}}$ and $f_{\max}$. Our simulations predict that the value of peak $f_{\mathrm{t}}$ decreases below 100 K due to increase in the emitter junction capacitance and the peak $f_{\max}$ increase is due to decrease in collector junction capacitance and base resistance. The aggregate metric $f_{\mathrm{t}}+f_{\max} > 1.2\ \text{THz}$ is achieved under cryogenic condition without scaling the device, this advantage can be utilized in the THz device applications.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776700","CSIR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776700","THz;BiCMOS;SiGe;HBT;Cryogenic temperature;$f_{t}$;$f_{max}$;current gain;Gummel-characteristics;bandgap engineering","Performance evaluation;Resistance;Temperature;Photonic band gap;Cryogenics;Germanium;Capacitance","BiCMOS integrated circuits;cryogenic electronics;Ge-Si alloys;heterojunction bipolar transistors;MOSFET;semiconductor device models;technology CAD (electronics)","THz device design;SiGe HBT;sub-room temperature;cryogenic condition;BiCMOS technology;possible replacement;higher transconductance;THz range;higher voltage handling ability;advanced SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor technology;maximum oscillation frequency;TCAD analysis;performance metrics;different cryogenic temperatures;calibrated Gummel characteristics;record DC current gain;bandgap engineering;Ge concentration;base region;device performance;cryogenic operation;HBT device results;THz device applications;linearly graded germanium profile;FDSOI;FinFET technology;DC current gain;collector junction capacitance;base resistance;frequency 370.0 GHz;temperature 77.0 K;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;frequency 320 GHz;SiGe","","1","","18","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Truthfulness of all derived equations is verified by comparing with numerical simulations. As expected, the IV gets limited by the device's series resistance (Rs) at high forward bias. However, whether the PIN IV is linear, or parabolic (or in between) depends on which of the P, I, and/or N layer(s) dominate(s) the Rs. A transition from linear to parabolic behavior is observed as the width of the intrinsic layer is increased. Equations for the knee voltages and series resistances are also analytically derived, and are corroborated with numerical simulations.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776986","IIT Bombay(grant numbers:RD/0118-MNRE000-001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776986","PIN diode;IV characteristics;series resistance;dark IV;PIN solar cell","Resistance;PIN photodiodes;Photovoltaic cells;Conferences;Linearity;Numerical simulation;Mathematical models","numerical analysis;p-i-n diodes;semiconductor device models","device series resistance;simple analytical expressions;current-voltage characteristic;PIN diode;I-layer width;numerical simulations;high forward bias;N layer;parabolic behavior;intrinsic layer;knee voltages;PIN dark IV parabolicity;material intrinsic Debye length","","","","7","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two types of inverter chains are studied, (i) cascaded type and (ii) parallel type.

In this article, we have designed a unique configuration of actuation electrode biasing to achieve low loss and high RF performance. This designed configuration provides high performance and reduces the size of the structure due to change in the inductance and capacitance of the transmission line by the defect grounded structures (DGS).

The simulation involves correlating the impact of changes in reactor conditions such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates of carrier gases on the concentration gradients across the boundary layer to the growth surface which determines the control on growth and thus the crystal quality. The observations from the simulations point towards vapor phase reactions dominating at the inlet of the reactor due to a sudden rise in temperatures leading to constant gradients across the reactor. The effect of pressure is significant in reducing the concentration depletion across the reactor chamber, which helps control the partial pressures of precursors over the growth surface. The simulations predict constant gradients to result in similar nucleation densities and growth rates across the length of the reactor irrespective of position. We observe similar findings experimentally, which correlate to the simulations. This result highlights the importance of physicochemical modeling to enable the predictive growth of 2D materials across large areas for device applications.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776702","MHRD; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776702","Modelling and Simulation;Chemical Vapor Deposition;Molybdenum Disulphide","Grain size;Gases;Simulation;Conferences;Predictive models;Temperature control;Sulfur","chemical vapour deposition;molybdenum compounds;nucleation;semiconductor growth;semiconductor materials;surface structure","MoSe2;concentration gradients;growth surface;vapor phase reactions;constant gradients;reactor chamber;surface structure;chemical vapor deposition;2D materials;nucleation densities;physicochemical modeling;crystal quality;carrier gas flow rates;boundary layer","","","","10","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigated these effects on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) fin field effect transistor (FinFET) electro-thermal performance by TCAD analysis considering Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons with relaxation time approximation. Results showed that the channel kth is reduced for $\mathrm{W}_{\text{Fin}} < 50\ \text{nm}$, doping $\mathrm{N} > 1\times 10^{19}\ \text{cm}-3$ and it is further degraded due to increasing local hot-spot temperature. However, Silicon-on-diamond (SOD) technology improves the device ET performance due to increase in heat energy flux through diamond (higher kth) BOX layer towards the substrate. Impact of within-chip ambient temperature $(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{A}})$ on device logic performance reveals that the SOD FinFET exhibits lower hot-spot temperature compared to conventional SOI FinFET. It is also revealed that with SOD technology, FinFETs can be aggressively scale down to sub-10nm node with better lattice heat mitigation, which improves the FinFET logic performance.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9777080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777080","SOI;SOD;FinFET;self-heating effect (SHE);thermal conductivity;ambient temperature;logic performance","Performance evaluation;Heating systems;Lattices;Channel estimation;Silicon-on-insulator;Phonons;Doping","Boltzmann equation;diamond;elemental semiconductors;MOSFET;silicon-on-insulator;technology CAD (electronics);thermal conductivity","conventional SOI FinFET;SOD technology;lattice heat mitigation;FinFET logic performance;nonequilibrium channel heat transport;technology scaling;advanced logic technologies;fin channel thermal conductivity;silicon-on-insulator fin field effect transistor;Boltzmann transport equation;relaxation time approximation;local hot-spot temperature;silicon-on-diamond technology;device ET performance;heat energy flux;diamond BOX layer;within-chip ambient temperature;device logic performance;device SHE;SOD FinFET;electro-thermal performance;fin thickness;source-drain regions doping;enhanced phonon boundary scattering;phonon-dopant impurity;Si-C","","","","17","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The field emission scanning electron microscopy results indicated that the nanowires are dense and preferentially oriented. The peak observed at around 3.42 eV in the photoluminescence spectra corresponding to GaN band edge emission confirms that the nanowires are of high optical quality. For UV sensor measurements two Indium contacts were soldered on the surface of the nanowires and resistance between the ohmic contacts was measured as a function of time. The sensor response was measured as the ratio of change in resistance upon exposure to UV to the resistance in air. GaN nanowires showed a response of 2.2% upon exposure to UV with a fast response time. Through this work we show that GaN nanowires on Si (211) substrates are suitable candidates for UV sensing applications.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776961","GaN nanowires;PAMBE;UV sensors","Scanning electron microscopy;Stimulated emission;Molecular beam epitaxial growth;Photoluminescence;Silicon;Time measurement;Nanowires","electric resistance;field emission scanning electron microscopy;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;II-VI semiconductors;indium;molecular beam epitaxial growth;nanofabrication;nanosensors;nanowires;ohmic contacts;photoluminescence;plasma materials processing;semiconductor epitaxial layers;semiconductor growth;soldering;ultraviolet detectors;wide band gap semiconductors","silicon substrates;photoluminescence spectroscopy;field emission scanning electron microscopy;band edge emission;UV sensor measurements;catalyst free plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy grown nanowires;III-nitrides;preferentially oriented;optical quality;indium contacts;soldered;ohmic contacts;resistance change;fast response time;GaN;Si;GaN-In","","","","38","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The neurological disorders include Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, spino cerebellar degenerations, etc., In all these diseases the limbs of the patient move involuntarily and rhythmically. It can affect any part of the body either one side or both the sides symmetrically. The neuro physician during the assessment of the patient depends on video-grapy or Electromyography or both. Even then the physician does not get the complete information, as these techniques are very primitive, apart from being uneconomical. Also they require lot of time for recording and analysis. Even the information preservation also becomes difficult. In certain cases, the physician mainly depends on the feedback from the patient. In order to overcome these difficulties and also to reduce the time and even cost, a technique has been proposed and implemented. The technique involves recording the tremor using a tri-axial accelerometer, which can be fastened to the limb, where the measurements need to be recorded. The analog output from the accelerometer is amplified and fed to a microcontroller for onward transmission of the sampled values to PC. In PC a Matlab program acquires these samples and processes the same for amplitude and frequency related information. The data was obtained from 15 patients having various neurological disorders and a set of 10 controlled groups is also considered. Both the group's data have been analyzed and the results are reported.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776853","Tremor analysis;Accelerometer;FFT;Data acquisition","Accelerometers;Neurological diseases;Parkinson's disease;Microcontrollers;Process control;Medical services;Electromyography","accelerometers;biomechanics;diseases;electromyography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;patient treatment","diseases;limb;neuro physician;information preservation;tri-axial accelerometer;frequency related information;neurological disorders;parameter extraction;tremor signals;involuntary movement;Parkinson's disease;Huntington disease;spino cerebellar degenerations;videograpy;electromyography","","","","5","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, Si-based Hall sensors are used for most usages requiring low field sensitivity. For higher sensitivity, III-V semiconductors such as GaAs, InSb, etc., provide better alternatives due to higher carrier mobilities at room temperature. In this work, Hall sensors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the heterostructure of InAs/AlSb are fabricated. The 2DEG is about 20 nm below the surface. Carrier density of $3.2\times 1016/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and mobility of 1.8 m2/Vs were deduced via Hall measurements at RT. 1/f-noise analyses were carried out to calculate the magnetic field resolution of $\sim 1\ \mu\mathrm{T}/\text{Hz}^{1/2}$. To demonstrate the application of Hall devices as magnetic field sensors, we also simulated the distortions in the geomagnetic field due to the presence of a ferromagnetic object. The magnetic field drops to about 10% ($5 \mu\mathrm{T}$) if we move 10cm away from the magnetic object. Our simulations show that the sensor fabricated in this work will be capable of detecting such distortions in the geomagnetic field from 10 cm.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776959","MHRD; DRDO; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776959","Heterostructure;Two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG);Hall effect;Magnetic Sensor;Simulation","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Sensitivity;Magnetic sensors;HEMTs;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Distortion","1/f noise;aluminium compounds;carrier density;ferromagnetic materials;Hall effect transducers;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;magnetic field measurement;magnetic sensors;two-dimensional electron gas","vector sensors;carrier mobilities;2DEG;Hall measurements;magnetic field resolution;Hall effect based magnetic field sensor devices;III-V semiconductors;two-dimensional electron gas;carrier density;1/f-noise analyses;geomagnetic field distortions;ferromagnetic object;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;magnetic flux density 5 muT;distance 10.0 cm;InAs-AlSb","","","","21","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detection of blood glucose using non-enzymatic sensors is desirable to achieve a low detection limit in diabetic patients, who typically have blood glucose levels in a reference range of 1.1 - 20.08 mM. Low cost, biocompatible and stable copper oxide films have been developed in this work. Synthesis of the copper oxide nanomaterial was carried out in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) of gallic acid: choline chloride: ethylene glycol, which acts as a stabilizing agent, ensuring stability (∼ several months for CuO). Synthesized particles were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), selected area electron diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and photoluminescence (PL). TEM data revealed nanoparticle diameters in the range of 56–60 nm. Under 325 nm excitation, films based on these nanoparticles exhibit a strong PL emission at 341nm, a shoulder peak at 410 nm, and deep level defect at 561 nm in addition to 664 nm emissions. As a preliminary study prior to incorporation in a sensing device consisting of an integrated PL (UV) source-driven colorimetric display, glucose spiked solutions (∼ 0.001 M) were added to the CuO film and studied under PL excitation. The emission spectrum exhibited a time-dependent, broad strongly enhanced fluorescent feature in 414–540 nm range on interaction with glucose. This establishes the initial feasibility of a real-time, regenerative, low-cost glucose sensing platform.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776753","Nanoparticles;CuO;glucose;photoluminescence","Nanoparticles;Solvents;Scanning electron microscopy;X-ray scattering;Transmission electron microscopy;X-ray diffraction;Glucose","biosensors;blood;copper compounds;deep levels;electron diffraction;fluorescence;nanofabrication;nanoparticles;nanosensors;photoluminescence;scanning electron microscopy;semiconductor growth;semiconductor materials;semiconductor thin films;sugar;thin film sensors;transmission electron microscopy;X-ray chemical analysis;X-ray diffraction","nonenzymatic sensors;biocompatible copper oxide films;copper oxide nanomaterial;deep eutectic solvent;gallic acid;choline chloride;ethylene glycol;selected area electron diffraction;photoluminescence;nanoparticle diameters;deep level defect;glucose sensing;CuO","","","","25","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The resolution of a QMS varies with the square of its length (for a fixed frequency). Thus, MEMS scale QMS have limited resolution due to their small lengths. Also, macroscale QMS requires higher vacuum levels as the scattering tends to degrade the resolution. The length scales in 3-D printed devices promise a better balance between resolution and higher-pressure operation than previous miniaturization efforts. This paper reports a design and fabrication of portable QMS using 3-D printing technology. 3-D printing provides a more optimum scale for miniaturizing QMS as the devices can be a few cm's in length with the various components being correctly aligned. The simulation of QMS is performed using COMSOL Multiphysics. Mathieu's first stability region is plotted for the base peaks of chemicals in the range 20-200 amu. The 3-D printed prototype of QMS is illustrated with hollow cathode as an ionizer, quadrupole mass filter as a mass analyzer, and Faraday cup as a detector. N2+ ions are passed through the QMS for preliminary testing of the device. A 2 MHz AC signal is applied to the mass filter. Preliminary testing gave a current of $22\ \mu\mathrm{A}$ when the device was tuned to N2+ and $0\ \mu\mathrm{A}$ when the mass filter voltage is not applied.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9777055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777055","Quadrupole mass filter;stability region;ion trajectories;mass spectrum","Printing;Performance evaluation;Micromechanical devices;Solid modeling;Prototypes;Scattering;Voltage","mass spectrometer accessories;mass spectrometers;micromachining;micromechanical devices","quadrupole mass spectrometers;micromachined devices;MEMS scale QMS;macroscale QMS;3D printed devices;portable QMS;3D printed prototype;quadrupole mass filter","","","","12","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effects of substitution doping such as shift in Dirac point with bandgap engineering, change in carrier sheet density, and quantum capacitance are explicitly captured in this model. The effect of quantum capacitance near the Dirac point is imperative in graphene-based devices. Consequently, the quantum capacitance of B or N substitution doped graphene near the Dirac point is modeled extensively with the effective gate capacitance as a series combination of insulating capacitance and quantum capacitance. The proposed 2T B substitution doped MIG is exhibiting improved channel sheet charge density and exhibiting the on/off channel sheet charge density of $2.32\times 10^{3}$ for 6.25% of B-doping concentration and $2.74\times 10^{4}$ for 25% of B-doping concentration. Subsequently, the bipolar gating effect is significantly suppressed in the case of 2T B-doped MIG when compared with 2T undoped MIG. Hence, modeling the electrostatics of substitution doped 2T MIG manifests in understanding the physical phenomenon to design the graphene-based FET with significant on/off ratio and substitution doping in graphene makes it highly suitable in digital applications.","","978-1-7281-8660-3","10.1109/ICEE50728.2020.9776824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776824","Dirac point;doping of graphene;Fermi-Dirac integral;quantum capacitance;two-terminal electrostatics","Poisson equations;Graphene;Doping;Mathematical models;Semiconductor process modeling;Quantum capacitance;Nitrogen","boron;carrier density;equivalent circuits;field effect transistors;graphene devices;nitrogen;Poisson equation;semiconductor doping;wide band gap semiconductors","graphene-based FET;substitution doping;Dirac point;carrier sheet density;quantum capacitance;graphene-based devices;effective gate capacitance;insulating capacitance;2T B substitution doped MIG;improved channel sheet charge density;B-doping concentration;bipolar gating effect;2T B-doped MIG;2T undoped MIG;electrostatics modeling;2-terminal boron;nitrogen substitution doped metal-insulator-graphene;MIG structure;Poissons equation;MIG electrical equivalent circuit;channel sheet charge density;C:N;C:B","","","","20","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Normally, IoT nodes are powered with the conventional batteries, but since the lifetime of battery is constrained and often their replacement is impracticable. Thus, there is strong need of self-powered devices or alternative sources of energy to continuously power the IoT devices. Proposed solution to this limitation is use of vibration based Micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) piezoelectric energy harvester that could provide a free, green, and virtually unlimited secondary powering source over traditional energy sources (batteries). Due recent development in field of MEMS technology, vibration energy harvesting is gaining attention and with an abundant vibration energy available generate power using MEMS devices within microwatts to few mW ranges, it is going to become the technology of future. In this paper we are proposing variants of circular membrane type of MEMS structures which can be used for piezoelectric vibrational energy harvesting and sensing.

Their penetration degree and characteristics of the injected active power must be known as good as possible to evaluate the effects on the operation of the ADNs. Based on these considerations, a data mining-based methodology is proposed to identify the real behavioural characteristics of prosumers, represented by the injected active power typical profiles (IAPTPs), within the ADNs. Inside the methodology, the K-means clustering method was used to obtain the IAPTPs of the prosumers. The testing was done using a database with 64 prosumers, having PV systems installed, that inject the active power in the LV electric distribution networks of the DNO from the north-eastern region of Romania. The proposed methodology represents an efficient solution to identify easy and quickly the real behavioural characteristics of the prosumers, helping the DNOs to evaluate the impact on the operation of the ADNs.","","978-1-7281-9038-9","10.1109/ISFEE51261.2020.9756166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756166","behavioural characteristics;prosumers;active distribution networks;data mining;K-means clustering","Voltage measurement;Phase measurement;Process control;Distribution networks;Load management;Planning;Data mining","data mining;distributed power generation;distribution networks;pattern clustering;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing","active distribution networks;ADN;distribution network operators;data mining-based methodology;behavioural characteristics;injected active power typical profiles;LV electric distribution networks;IAPTP;K-means clustering method;PV systems;DNO;Romania","","4","","17","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The set points of the current and torque are generated by a lookup table searching and a spline interpolation process with Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) algorithm. The cost function has been improved by adding the AF term. In this case, it is searched the magnetic flux that ensures the high torque developed by the IPMSM. The numerical simulations performed for different cost functions present different particularities. The cost function form influences the output response of the speed and torque. It can be concluded that the cost function may be selected for reducing the computational effort based on statistical analysis.","","978-1-7281-9038-9","10.1109/ISFEE51261.2020.9756135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756135","active flux (AF);Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (IPMSM);cost function;predictive controller;speed response","Permanent magnet machines;Magnetic flux;Tracking loops;Torque;Statistical analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Cost function","interpolation;linear systems;machine control;magnetic flux;permanent magnet machines;PI control;predictive control;splines (mathematics);statistical analysis;synchronous machines;table lookup;torque control","interior permanent magnet synchronous machine;IPMSM;linear PI controller;electromagnetic torque;magnetic flux;predictive controller;cost function form;active flux based predictive control;speed tracking;external loop;lookup table searching;spline interpolation;maximum torque per ampere;MTPA;numerical simulations;output response;statistical analysis","","","","12","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The salt crystallization from saliva forms a certain pattern called ferning which can determine the level of estrogen. There are three important stages: no ferning, partial ferning and full ferning. The proposed system intends to automatically determine the fertile period in a cheap, easy, and precise way. The proposed system includes a hardware part, making a miniaturized microscopic device with high performance for image acquisition, and a software able to analyze the images and displaying real-time results based on human saliva samples. For the image processing part, we propose two approaches. The first approach implies the use of the Bag of Words concept, were the words are patches with different ferning styles. For words description we use: CLAHE for image enhancement, Otsu and Frangi filter for ferning emphasis, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for feature representation of words. For final classification, a support vector machine (SVM) was used, and we classify the frequency of words in one image (the histogram of words). The second image processing approach uses a convolutional neuronal network (CNN). The experimental results show that the proposed system can be used to classify the ferning stage in salivary images, with an accuracy of 0.96 using the SVM classification.","","978-1-7281-9038-9","10.1109/ISFEE51261.2020.9756142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756142","microscopic salivary images;ferning/ crystallization texture;BoW image analyses;SVM;CNN","Support vector machines;Performance evaluation;Image recognition;Microscopy;Crystallization;Prediction algorithms;Software","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image classification;image enhancement;image representation;image segmentation;medical image processing;support vector machines","microscopic images analysis;saliva ferning prediction;estrogen level;menstrual cycle;salt crystallization;saliva forms;pattern called ferning;partial ferning;fertile period;image acquisition;human saliva samples;image processing part;words description;image enhancement;ferning emphasis;local binary pattern;image processing approach;ferning stage;salivary images;CLAHE;feature representation;support vector machine;convolutional neuronal network","","","","12","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The Initial Temperature Rise in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator as a Tool in the Detection of Stator Inter-Turn Short-Circuits","M. Barrett","Engineers Ireland (IEI), Dublin, Republic of Ireland","2020 International Symposium on Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering (ISFEE)","20 Apr 2022","2020","","","1","6","The permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) has many of the characteristics required for wind and tidal-stream generators. It is however, prone to stator winding inter-turn short-circuits, which can progress to catastrophic failure. This paper explores the possibility of detecting inter-turn short-circuits by analysis of the generator’s temperature rise under stator open-circuit conditions. The platform for detecting and flagging temperature rise is the programmable controller (PLC). The effects of, and the detection of inter-turn short-circuits from the literature are examined. A series of experiments to capture generator temperature at 5-minute intervals at different output frequencies and at different starting temperatures is carried out. From those experimental results it was evident that there was detectable temperature difference between a normal and a faulted stator winding in the first 5 minutes of operation. A methodology to detect, and within the 5-minute time scale, flag this abnormal temperature rise is proposed. The novelty of this approach is that it focusses on the rate of change of the PMSG temperature rise rather than absolute values. This is relevant as PMSG initial temperatures can vary due to operational and environmental factors. The methodology proposed was found to be robust. Further work will explore temperature rise under generator load conditions.","","978-1-7281-9038-9","10.1109/ISFEE51261.2020.9756141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756141","condition monitoring;marine application;PLC;PMSG","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Temperature;Stator windings;Generators;Synchronous generators;Permanent magnets","fault diagnosis;machine control;permanent magnet generators;programmable controllers;stators;synchronous generators","PMSG initial temperature;faulted stator winding;PLC;programmable controller;generator load conditions;PMSG temperature rise;generator temperature;stator open-circuit conditions;stator winding inter-turn short-circuits;tidal-stream generators;permanent magnet synchronous generator;time 5 min","","1","","18","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, on a ship we can frequently meet electrical and electronic equipment from several generations and from several manufacturers, equipment that has been designed based on different standards. Moreover, due to cost issues, the general trend is to purchase off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment that has not been designed to naval military standards. This requires a thorough analysis of the electromagnetic environment in which the new equipment will operate and compliance with all rules and principles of electromagnetic compatibility during their installation and operation.In this paper the authors make an analysis of trends in the construction and modernization of military ships and propose a way to calculate the magnetic field of dispersal disturbance at a point inside a space / volume in order to assess the electromagnetic environment and establish appropriate antiperturbation measures when introducing a new electrical or electronic equipment in the analyzed space / place.","","978-1-7281-9038-9","10.1109/ISFEE51261.2020.9756176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756176","electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);military ships;magnetic field;dispersive disturbance;electric machine;costs;modernization","Magnetic field measurement;Electronic equipment;Magnetic noise;Electromagnetic compatibility;Market research;Frequency measurement;Magnetic fields","electromagnetic compatibility;marine vehicles;military vehicles;naval engineering","magnetic field;COTS equipment;purchase off-the-shelf;leakage magnetic field;global modeling;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic environment;naval military standards;off-the-shelf equipment;electronic equipment;electrical equipment;ship compartment;military ship","","","","28","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model targets specifically the CALB CA180FA LiFePO4 cell used in automotive industry for Electric Vehicles (EV) or in Energy Storage Systems (ESS). There are no models currently implemented for the LiFePO4 battery cells, which affects the simulation process of the systems. The model proves of utmost importance in simulating battery-powered systems, energy storage systems and Battery Management Systems (BMS), helping in understanding the impact these circuits have on batteries they are powered from or are designed for.

Since from the application perspective (low-pass bandwidth), very large time constants are needed for an on-chip solution, the time constants are obtained by using the output resistance of unity gain buffer, where the transistors are biased in weak inversion and loaded by a capacitance multiplier. Based on the possibility of electronic tunability of a capacitance multiplier, a variable corner frequency over two decades (up to kHz) is obtained. The filter prototype was implemented using 180-nm AMS technology. It is shown that for the nominal case, a cut-off frequency of 250 Hz was obtained using a power consumption of 89 nA from a power supply of 1.8 V, for a pseudodifferential solution, and a figure of merit of 0.6 x 10-15 J.

This is a special challenge for any specialist in the domain both due to the particularly high density of technical means that are available on board military ships, and the fact that radio communication systems can be both sources of disturbance and victims. In obtaining the EMC of the systems, the inter and intrasystem disturbances must be identified and analysed. In order to fulfil the missions of combat, search and rescue and more recently, maritime surveillance and interception of boats with emigrants or refugees, military ships are constituted in naval groups. Such a group often includes ships under different flags, which are equipped with equipment and equipment from different suppliers and from different generations. In this sense, the entire naval grouping must be considered as a system, and the success of the mission may depend on the EMC's provision of the entire system.In the present paper, the authors present an algorithm for calculating the interference margins, necessary to obtain the EMC of a communications system related to a naval grouping starting from the basic EMC equation.

Sometimes, due to specific reasons, the limited laboratory infrastructure does not allow a correct match between theoretical concepts that apply to large equipment and experimental devices existing in the laboratory that are typically small power ones. Such a situation may happen for example when studying the electric transformer. During the practical laboratory activities the students may notice a discrepancy between the theoretical concepts and the obtained experimental results because the small power transformers available in the laboratory have operation characteristics whose shapes are different with respect to those of the large power transformers. Thus, this paper proposes a design procedure for didactic purpose small power transformers, that allow the identification of solutions with predominant reactive component of the short-circuit voltage.

The significance of argon flow rate, that used during film deposition, on the observing of Se loss, antimony oxide formation and the change in the surface morphology was also addressed. We observed that the dominant crystal orientation varied with respect to argon flow rate. It was further detected that high argon flow rates cause the decomposition of Sb2Se3 structure and formation of antimony oxide phase.

The general observation brings us to the severity of such climatic conditions on the durability of standard PV modules. This is noticeable not only at the level of the different aging mechanisms but also in terms of degradation rate values. The various degradation mechanisms are manifested by hotspots, cracks, encapsulants discolorations, potential induced degradation (PID), and delamination and snail tracks. In addition, degradation rates ranged from 2.02% up to 2.73%.

Since the properties of the chalcogenides have been studied intensively, the Sb2Se3 material has come into prominence. In thin film technology, the most effective ways of increasing the performance are the rate of photon absorption, long material life, carrier efficiency and the quality of the interface. Sb2Se3 gets more attention than others due to its optoelectronic properties. Sb2Se3 has a suitable band gap (Eg), long term material stability, and a relatively simple composition with non-toxic and earth abundant elements. All these features make Sb2Se3 a promising candidate for use as an absorber layer in thin film photovoltaics (PVs). In this study, Sb2Se3 films have been grown with DC magnetron sputtering method onto soda lime glass (SLG) substrates with different time durations. Morphological, structural, and optical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films were systematically investigated as a function of the thickness for photovoltaic applications.

The stochastic nature of PV output has created new challenges in electric distribution systems' operation and maintenance. Of particular significance is the direct correlation between the PV power output and rapid voltage fluctuations. Reactive power compensation can be used to regulate the voltage profile on the network within the allowable limits set by the relevant standards. A capacitor-less distribution static synchronous compensator (D-STATCOM), based on a matrix converter (MC), is proposed to be used in low-voltage distribution networks.

Solar radiation data collecting from the ground-based meteorological station seems still the most reliable compared to others such as satellite databases. In literature, there is a number of recent studies that utilize directly old measure solar radiation data without any precaution. As a consequence, the solar system can be exposed to poor technoeconomic assessment. This paper attempts to find a close agreement to enhance the old measured data within the period 1971 and 2003 to make it more applicable for further studies and applications.

Three different transposition models were used, which are the isotropic sky-diffuse, HDKR, and Perez models. Photovoltaic Geographical Information System-Surface Solar Radiation Dataset Heliosat (PVGISSARAH) database was used as the long-term satellite-based data, which includes the time period 2005-2016 with hourly time resolution, and three different typical meteorological year (TMY) datasets were used to compare the results with P50 values. Actual energy yield data of the years 2016 and 2017 were also compared. Interannual variability of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) was found as about 2.21%. According to the comparison of TMY and P50 values, it was found that average TMY underpredicted the annual GHI by 5.15%, and the energy yield values by 6.77%, 6.86%, and 6.83% for the isotropic, HDKR, and Perez models, respectively. Normal distribution assumption was also compared with the empirical method, and P50 value was underpredicted by 0.43% and 0.93% on average for GHI and energy yield, respectively. On the other hand, Normal CDF overpredicted P90 values than the empirical CDF by 2.61% and 3.93% for GHI and the energy yield, respectively. The overall uncertainty of energy yield was found as about 7.08%.

Both have oil-rich economies with low electrical utility prices, which render photovoltaic (PV) systems less financially attractive to consumers. However, a strong case can be made for for PV in oil-rich economies. First, energy generation from solar PV allows for higher profit gains of precious export commodities (oil and/or gas) instead of using them locally. Second, sunny weather conditions in most oil-rich countries, like Qatar, allow for more sustained and predictable PV generation with fewer interruptions. This paper presents a techno-economic study that explores the economic benefits associated with implementing a grid-connected rooftop photovoltaic and energy storage system (PV-ESS) in oil-based countries. Two case studies were used as examples of implementation in different parts of the world: Texas, USA, and Doha, Qatar. In both cases, a long-term simulation of a house with an installed PV-ESS system is used to determine the economic feasibility of residential PV. Factors like generation and load profiles, cost of grid consumption, cost of materials, and house size were considered in this study. Based on the study, house owners in Texas can breakeven their PV-ESS system cost, while in Qatar, this is more challenging. In addition to the techno-economic study results in this paper, the barriers-to-entry of solar PV in oil-rich countries are explored and discussed.","","978-1-6654-1981-9","10.1109/PVCon51547.2020.9757759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9757759","Photovoltaic;Energy Storage Systems;Residential Rooftop Installations;Renewable Energy Systems;Cost Analysis;Multi-objective Optimization","Photovoltaic systems;Electric potential;Costs;Oils;Tariffs;Solar energy;Optimization","building integrated photovoltaics;gas industry;petroleum industry;photovoltaic power systems;power generation economics;power grids","techno-economic evaluation;residential PV systems;Qatar;high annual solar irradiance;high solar energy potential;oil-rich economies;low electrical utility prices;photovoltaic systems;energy generation;solar PV;higher profit gains;export commodities;oil-rich countries;sustained PV generation;predictable PV generation;economic benefits;grid-connected rooftop photovoltaic;energy storage system;oil-based countries;installed PV-ESS system;economic feasibility;PV-ESS system cost;techno-economic study results;Texas;gas-rich economies;electrical utility prices;sunny weather conditions;USA;Doha;long-term simulation;load profiles;grid consumption;barriers-to-entry","","","","16","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though solar energy is abundant and within reach, this energy assessment confronts a big challenge in terms of obtaining measured data due to the limited and unevenly distributed ground-based meteorological stations. To overcome this issue, many studies resort to other sources of radiometric data. Some of the sources are based on satellites. As a result, there is a disagreement of readings compared with ground-based meteorological stations. Therefore, this paper attempts to mitigate the differences by proposing the nearest source compared to measured data. Four different sources (NASA POWER, PVGIS 5, Meteonorm software, and hybrid-based average data) are investigated. The measured data of stations is used as a reference in this study which has been collected from the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC). The comparative study is made based on monthly average horizontal solar radiation using statistical methods for five continents. Twenty-eight distributed locations are examined.

Also, the NS arrays can be employed as an effective medium on the SC surface to decrease reflectance and enable better forward scattering. As a result, not only can uniform arrays of NSs on the surface of the SC behave as antireflection coatings, but they also act as micro-lenses, which are considered surface distributed light concentrators that can be utilized in the field of concentrated photovoltaics. The fabrication of NS-based light-trapping structures is cost-effective and simple compared to other options such as vacuum evaporated multilayer antireflection coatings. In this study, experimental results of shape modified NS structures resulting from annealing entail improved light harvesting and better efficiency in Si SCs.

This component is commanded by a control algorithm which allows it to identify and track the maximum power point of the PV array throughout any weather conditions. Several approaches in the literature are proposed to accomplish this task, among the well-known, the intelligent commands such as Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). although FLC has many advantages such as convergence time, precision, efficiency, etc. there are always some drawbacks like the complexity of the controller, the hard algorithm implementation. For this purpose, a new approach has been proposed, using the FLC dataset retrieved from the simulation to build a decision tree model (DTM) obtaining both advantages of FL and DTM. Therefore, 66% of the data set will be allocated to the learning process and the rest is for the model test. The learning process is performed based on the C4.5 algorithm, where splitting criteria used to form the tree is called the gain ratio, this one is applied over the data set recursively to find the best model that fittest with FLC data. A validation step was carried out to verify the performances of the model by using new data unseen by the learning process. Lastly, the results have shown that the DT model has a high correlation with the FLC combining both advantages of the two approaches, moreover, the new model has compared with P&O and PID controllers and shown high effectiveness.","","978-1-6654-1981-9","10.1109/PVCon51547.2020.9757758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9757758","PV cell model;DC/DC boost converter;Maximum Power Point Tracker;Fuzzy Logic Controller;Decision Tree Model","Fuzzy logic;Maximum power point trackers;Photovoltaic systems;Correlation;Data models;Complexity theory;Decision trees","DC-DC power convertors;decision trees;fuzzy control;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum power point trackers;photovoltaic power systems;power generation control;three-term control;tracking","new decision tree Controller;MPPT;Fuzzy Logic Controller data;grid-connected PV system;control algorithm;maximum power point;PV array;weather conditions;intelligent commands;convergence time;hard algorithm implementation;FLC dataset;decision tree model;DTM;learning process;model test;FLC data;DT model","","","","12","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An automated mechatronics testbed was developed to allow highly repeatable testing needed to create a library of arc voltage and current waveforms. Electrode material and geometry, electrical voltage and current, and electrode gap separation profile were set as experimental parameters. These factors are hypothesized to affect the electrical characteristics and signature of the arc. In this paper, examples of data from the arc generation system are presented to showcase how the results of the parameter values can be compared. For each parameter value combination, or ""recipe,"" the paper will show how the testbed is used to capture and plot the arc voltage and current time-domain waveforms, the gap profile (separation distance vs. time), and the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the measured electrical signals.

Therefore, many research and developments have been taking place on this type of solar cell to increase the overall solar cell performance. In this study, different type of rear local contact opening patterns (line and dash) formed by industrial-type picosecond laser which has 532 nm wavelength with fixed laser contact opening (LCO) width on M2 p-type mono commercial blue wafers. Manufactured cells are investigated in terms of photovoltaic parameters depending on the rear metal fractions. We ablate rear dielectric passivation layer with 4 different LCO patterns by varying rear local contact pitches from 900 μm to 1200 μm by an increment of 100 μm using (1:1) dash pattern. Line pattern is used as reference pattern, which has 1500 μm line pitch and same contact width. Laser opening areas are analyzed by photoluminescence (PL) images as well as implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) measurements. Local contacts and formation of back surface field (BSF) has been analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for all types of LCOs after screen printing of aluminum paste. As a result, rear contact pattern with 3.19% metal fraction (1000 μm pitch) is found to be relatively more efficient than the others investigated in this study. When compared to reference line pattern, the optimized LCO pattern provides a gain in conversion efficiency of 0.35%, Voc of 6 mV and FF of 0.35 % on average.","","978-1-6654-1981-9","10.1109/PVCon51547.2020.9757782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9757782","Laser contact opening (LCO);rear local contact pattern;rear local contact pitch;PERC Solar Cells","Photovoltaic systems;Scanning electron microscopy;Liquid crystal on silicon;Voltage measurement;Surface waves;Photovoltaic cells;Surface emitting lasers","aluminium;elemental semiconductors;metallisation;passivation;photoluminescence;scanning electron microscopy;silicon;solar cells;surface recombination","comparative evaluation;rear local contact patterns;p-type mono crystalline silicon PERC solar cell;passivated emitter;rear cell;advantageous type;rear surface recombination;improved back surface reflectivity;solar cell performance;industrial-type picosecond laser;fixed laser contact opening width;p-type mono commercial blue wafers;manufactured cells;rear metal fractions;LCO patterns;rear local contact pitches;reference pattern;line pitch;contact width;laser opening areas;implied open circuit voltage measurements;surface field;rear contact pattern;metal fraction;reference line pattern;optimized LCO pattern;rear dielectric passivation layer;size 100.0 mum;size 1500.0 mum;voltage 6.0 mV;size 900.0 mum to 1200.0 mum;wavelength 532.0 nm","","","","5","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, solar cells are subjected to bending forces due to the effect of wind. To better understand the cracks propagation in standard cell and half-cell technology, under different mechanical loads, we used a 3D simulation. This allowed us to understand the response of each cell type and select the most resistant to mechanical stress as well. Two 3D finite element cells models were proposed. Each model represents a mini-module. In this investigation, different load intensities were applied. The result show that, under standard cell module the crack propagation is proportional to the applied mechanical load, which is not obvious for the half-cell module. The results obtained also show that the cracks propagate less in the half-cells. This is why the half-cell technology can be an alternative to increase the lifespan of PV module in arid and semi-arid regions.","","978-1-6654-1981-9","10.1109/PVCon51547.2020.9757766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9757766","Desert conditions;Cracks propagation;standard cell;half-cell;PV durability","Photovoltaic systems;Resistance;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Photovoltaic cells;Topology;Standards","bending;finite element analysis;photovoltaic cells;photovoltaic power systems;solar cells","half-cell photovoltaic technology;solar cells;dominant degradation mode;cracks propagation;half-cell technology;different mechanical loads;cell type;3D finite element cells models;different load intensities;standard cell module;crack propagation;applied mechanical load;half-cell module;half-cells","","","","8","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A flexible and scalable i-v curve tracer was developed to measure this experimentally. It consisted of a source measuring unit (SMU), a relay board, and a computer hosting MATLAB running a custom script to control the curve-tracer setup. However, the system is expensive for many institutions, such as developing countries, where researchers may lack resources and funding. Therefore, this paper describes an improvement to reduce the cost by replacing the computer with a $35 Raspberry Pi and the MATLAB script with a free Python program. The SMU and the relay board are connected to the Raspberry Pi through a USB cable and an ethernet cable, respectively. The new software provides four modes of operation called F1, F2, F3, and F4. The first mode is the one-time test mode (F1), in which the user tests one or multiple PV modules. In addition to generating individual plots, the software generates a composite figure of all the selected PV module curves, useful for comparative studies. The second mode, F2, runs a time-sequenced test of F1, in which users test a set of PV modules for a specific duration in regular intervals. The next mode (F3) enables different testing interconnections by configuring relays based on the connections described in an excel file. The final mode, F4, is a time-sequenced version of F3, by which users can test all the configurations in excel for a specific duration at regular intervals.","","978-1-6654-1981-9","10.1109/PVCon51547.2020.9757780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9757780","Photovoltaic;i-v curve;off-grid;in-situ","Photovoltaic systems;Costs;Measurement units;Ethernet;Universal Serial Bus;Software;Relays","cost reduction;electric current measurement;local area networks;microcomputers;peripheral interfaces;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;Python;relays;solar cells;voltage measurement","relay configuration;cost reduction;photovoltaic module efficiency;PV module curve;testing interconnection;in-situ PV curve trace;Raspberry Pi;Ethernet cable;USB cable;free Python program;MATLAB script;curve-tracer setup;custom script;relay board;SMU;source measuring unit;i-v curve tracer;photovoltaic module performance;i-v characteristic curve;specific duration;time-sequenced test;one-time test mode","","","","8","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Long-term satellite-based data is mostly available globally; however, their systematic errors and bias should be removed by integrating quality-checked ground measurements if available. In this study, a quality assessment was done to detect erroneous/ missing data points using several quality-control tests. In METU NCC, global horizontal irradiation (GHI), direct normal irradiation (DNI), and global tilted irradiation (GTI) were recorded since 2010, 2013 and 2016, respectively. Physical threshold and quality envelope tests revealed that lower-than- expected GHI values were measured in some periods. Thus, erroneous GHI data was estimated using the Erbs model and measured DNI data. While up to 2 hours of missing GHI data were filled by linear interpolation, more extended missing data were filled by estimated GHI. Both measured and constructed GHI data were compared with satellite-based GHI data downloaded from the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) for the time period 2010-2016. The results indicated that the average relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE) of daily total GHI reduced from 34.63% to 17.77% after the data filing process. The rRMSE decreased to 8.78% for the annual mean daily total GHI data. Additionally, GTI was estimated using the isotropic sky-diffuse model, and it was compared with measured GTI. RMSE of daily total estimated GTI was 22.41%, whereas satellite-based GTI had an RMSE of 20.81%.

In this study, we compare models obtained from International data, which comprise many races, and SE Asian data containing only one race. The results of the study reveal that races do influence the accuracy of the model. The International models are less accurate than those of SE Asian models are. We suspect that this happens because each race has its own personality level. This claim is supported by previous studies on personality differences across nations. These studies have found that personality differences across nations do exist. Therefore, we hypothesize that the more homogenous the data in terms of race, the more accurate the model.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732792","modeling;personality traits;demographic data;personality-based recommender system;cross-cultural personality difference;two-way analysis of variance","Analytical models;Predictive models;Data models;Recommender systems;Analysis of variance","behavioural sciences computing;demography;recommender systems","personality traits;demographic data;recommender systems;international data;SE Asian data;personality extraction from text;PET","","","","19","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can be minimized by doing erosion forecasts so that it can determine the appropriate mitigation. Estimate erosion by utilizing remote sensing technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) because the updates can be done quickly, covering a large and hard-to-reach area, and cheaper costs, so that it can be more effective and efficient. The modeling method used is the MUSLE method (Modified Universal Soil Equation). Modeling uses remote sensing data such as Sentinel 2A imagery, DEM ALOS PALSAR, and TRMM data. The use of TRMM data has improved the model through the addition of more accurate rainfall spatial information.

Cirrus cloud in particular is often contaminating satellite imagery and yet relatively difficult to visually detect in visible spectrum. Indonesia as one of the tropical countries has highly cloud cover almost throughout the year. This condition causes land covers are contaminated by cirrus cloud which alters the digital numbers. The availability of cirrus band in Landsat 8 brings an advantage to eliminate cirrus clouds by performing cirrus cloud effect estimation and simple regression method. In this experiment, image-based cirrus correction was implemented in Landsat-8 over Palangkaraya city with high cirrus contamination. Cirrus cloud effect is estimated by using simple linear regression method involving samples or training area over homogeneous area cirrus contamination. Homogeneous areas were defined based on visual interpretation and statistical calculation. After estimating cirrus cloud effect on the pixel, cirrus cloud correction was performed by using arithmetic operations on images based on the slope regression coefficient which corresponded with the highest coefficient of determination. The quality of the corrected image was also statistically evaluated using reference image without cirrus contamination. Not only was the digital number evaluated but also Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) was compared in order to estimate the implication of cirrus correction in further image analysis.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732778","U.S. Geological Survey; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732778","cirrus cloud correction;Landsat 8;image-based approach;various classification schemes","Earth;Training;Cloud computing;Visualization;Artificial satellites;Clouds;Urban areas","atmospheric optics;atmospheric techniques;clouds;geophysical image processing;ice;regression analysis;remote sensing;vegetation","cirrus cloud correction;corrected image;Landsat 8 image;combined image-based approach;highly cloud cover;cirrus band;cirrus cloud effect estimation;image-based cirrus correction;Landsat-8;high cirrus contamination;homogeneous area cirrus contamination","","","","15","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the use of airborne gravity of Sulawesi Island has not been optimal, including the use of gravity disturbance data components compared to gravity anomaly data that is more commonly used. In this research, mapping of gravity disturbance was done based on airborne gravity data and subsequently was applied for interpretation of the geodynamics of Sulawesi Island region. Gravity disturbance value was obtained through the conversion of free-air anomaly. The results showed that the gravity disturbance of Sulawesi Island ranged from -206.10 to 352.58 mGal with a pattern similar to the free-air anomaly and two global models (EGM2008 and EIGEN-6C4). The difference with EGM2008 and EIGEN-6C4 was an average of -3.77 and -3.43 mGal with a standard deviation of ±26.59 and ±26.21 mGal. The large difference is probably due to a data gap and topographic area of the mountains. Map of gravity disturbance can also be used for the initial interpretation of active faults such as Palu Koro and Matano which showed a significant color deviation from the representation of significant differences in subsurface geological structures.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732783","Sulawesi Island;airborne gravity;gravity disturbance;geophysics;geodynamics","Global navigation satellite system;Image color analysis;Fault location;Rocks;Surface topography;Geodynamics;Standards","geodesy;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;gravity;topography (Earth)","airborne gravity technique;gravity disturbance data components;gravity anomaly data;airborne gravity data;Sulawesi Island region;gravity disturbance value;free-air anomaly;EIGEN-6C4;data gap;topographic area;gravity disturbance derived","","","","22","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysing P-waves with manual inspection is difficult because P-waves are small, vary and have a noisy appearance. Automatic classification of P-waves to detect atrial abnormalities is necessary to assist clinicians with faster process. This paper presents a P-wave morphological analysis using a random forest classification from 134 patients. The algorithm defines the data into five classes, namely, Normal, Left Atrial enlargement (LAE), Right Atrial Enlargement (RAE), Biatrial Enlargement (BE) and Atrial Fibrillation (AFib). This study uses ECG Lead II data from 12 standard medical leads. Signal processing and denoising are applied by using two filters, a derivative and Butterworth filter. Feature extraction is explored by using a new local distance transform, which is more efficient than other similar methods. The features used are P-wave morphological attributes such as duration, amplitude, number of appearances, standard deviation, and symmetry. The overall accuracy of our approach was 94.77%, the specificity (SP) was 98%, while the sensitivity (Se) at 10-fold validating the training set was 930%.

Currently, the time aspect has been considered a lot in LRP to bring better service levels for a company as it shows how responsive a supply chain is. In completing service level objective, time windows have been used to measure whether the delivery is successful in the planned time or not. Moreover, LRP research has been advised to take on a multiple-objective approach, which are not available much. Therefore developing and testing a model with multiple objectives such as cost and service level is at most important. The model for this specific problem is designed and tested using exact goal programming method for small-case instance, i.e. 4 distribution centers and 8 retailers. This research has brought modeling of multi-objective location routing problem with time windows to minimize the total cost and maximize the service level (MOLRPTW-SL).

One of the most popular methods to keep the transformer from failing is to conduct dissolved gas analysis on transformer oil that is called Dissolved Gas-In-Oil Analysis (DGA). Duval's Triangle State Estimation Analysis is one of the popular DGA based methods. Because the behavior of DGA data is considered not linear, then a non-linear approach to improve the accuracy of this method is required. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate whether the non-linear approach based on fuzzy logic is able to provide an improvement in the accuracy of the Duval's method in diagnosing power transformer potential fault types based on DGA data.

DFIL offers more flexibility for the user or object point-of-view. The basic idea is to free the object from the device attached for localization process. The most popular technologies for DFIL are based on wireless technology. However, if we discuss the low-cost system, we have to discuss the fusion or hybrid of many sensors output data to increase accuracy. Some of the accessible technology used for these low-cost systems are wireless-based, i.e., Wi-Fi, ZigBee, radio frequency identification (RFID) and an optical-based, visible light communication (VLC). Wireless-based probably the most used in the low-cost and simple configuration of an indoor localization since the parameter used can be directly obtained from its device. The most used parameter in the wireless-based system is received signal strength indicator (RSSI), which merely the derivation of power by the distance. By this parameter, the technique such as trilateration, min-max, and RSSI database can be used as the location. In the DFIL, RSSI can be applied as the Wi-Fi -based radio map from two or more links and applying an algorithm such as the Bayes Inference, resulting in the accuracy of object tracking up to 86%. On the other hand, ZigBee applies to mesh network and need more nodes to gather more information for higher accuracy results. The RFID has advantages in no-contact, and a good accuracy even in non-line-of-sight (LoS) condition. Optical-based VLC can provide high accuracy but dependent on the light noise and shadow effect in the object. From these benefits and disadvantages of some low-cost systems, we can make the best of them by fusing the sensor or developing the hybrid system.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732779","indoor localization;device-free;low-cost;Wi-Fi;ZigBee;RFID;VLC","Location awareness;Integrated optics;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee;Sensor systems;Received signal strength indicator;Optical sensors","free-space optical communication;indoor communication;object tracking;radiofrequency identification;radionavigation;RSSI;wireless LAN;Zigbee","object point-of-view;localization process;DFIL;wireless technology;accessible technology;low-cost system;wireless-based system;optical-based VLC;hybrid system;simple configuration device-free indoor localization;visible light communication;received signal strength indicator;Wi-Fi based radio map;RSSI database;Zigbee;non-line-of sight condition;mesh network","","","","42","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the industries required to manage the supply chain by considering environmental aspects or called green supply chain management (GSCM) is a paper mill. In Indonesia, this industry has significant increased revenues, especially in the export sector. This research is done in an Indonesian paper mill. Previous research shows that GSCM measurements in paper companies are still very limited. The Green SCOR method is very relevant because it has complex and fit criteria for supply chain context by considering environmental aspects. In this study, researchers used the integrated Green SCOR and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). AHP is used for weighting so that the results obtained were more accurate. The results show that the paper mill is in the marginal category, with a value of 41,47. Then out of 31 KPIs there are 12 KPIs that categorized as red. The red KPI shows their performance is not satisfactory so it needs improvement.

Network jitter as a variable delay represents a serious problem in communication networks. Several attempts have been made to adjust the playout time of packets at the network node, which suffers from variable delay. Some of these attempts tend to make the playout time fixed; another advanced contribution is to have an adaptive scheme to cope with the variable network conditions. In this paper the optimal use of artificial intelligence as an effective tool for taking smart decisions is proposed as a solution to adapt the playout time. First an algorithm was developed to simulations single node in network in different conditions. Several network behavior patterns were extracted from these simulations to represent diverse jitter responses. Next, we introduce an adaptive approach using fuzzy logic model to estimate the playout time. The algorithm has been tested against different network condition patterns. Results reveal that the proposed approach has good results versus various delay conditions. Finally, a comparison has been made to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy logic approach.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732846","Fuzzy Logic;Jitter;Network;Playout Time","Fuzzy logic;Adaptation models;Neural networks;Packet loss;Quality of service;Jitter;Delays","delays;fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;jitter;quality of service;road safety;road traffic;video streaming","playout time;fuzzy logic approach;network jitter;variable delay;communication networks;network node;variable network conditions;network behavior patterns;different network condition patterns;delay conditions","","","","37","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The longest time-series data of NDVI from the earlier era of remote sensing satellites is available from AVHRR GIMMS employing the red and near-infrared bands in NOAA sensors from 1981 to 2015 in 8-km spatial resolution in the monthly interval. This study aims to evaluate the compatibility of NDVI data from the newer sensors such as MODIS Terra (MOD13C2), Proba-V and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data when combined with GIMMS data. Calibration between two time-series data from different sensors was constructed by using image-matching Pseudo Invariant Features (PIF) method and the fitness levels using all pixels and at different land-cover classes were assessed. In addition, structural change analysis was conducted to identify the sensor-shift problems at the best data combination. Our results suggested the best fit of GIMMS when being paired with VIIRS data with the R2 of 0.91 (n = 3132) and 0.89 (n = 1044) for model and validation analysis. Although the fitness level from the linear regression showed a good fit, an artifact as a result of sensor-shift problems still can be detected from structural change analysis, revealing the imperfection of linear calibration method. Future works should aim to explore the performance of non-linear methods to calibrate the different time-series data and explore the combination with other sensors.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732825","Image matching;Pseudo-Invariant Features;Structural Change;GIMMS;MODIS;PROBA-V;VIIRS","Statistical analysis;Linear regression;Time series analysis;Vegetation mapping;Data models;US Government agencies;Calibration","atmospheric techniques;calibration;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;infrared imaging;land surface temperature;radiometers;radiometry;regression analysis;remote sensing;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","sensor-shift problems;data combination;VIIRS data;fitness level;structural change analysis;different time-series data;multisensor combination;normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series data;Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data;commonly used vegetation proxy;remote sensing data;vegetation biophysical properties;remote sensing satellites;red infrared bands;near-infrared bands;NOAA sensors;NDVI data;newer sensors;Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data;GIMMS data;image-matching PseudoInvariant Features method;different land-cover classes","","","","23","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

OBE emphasizes how every educational process produces outcomes that can help students achieve the competencies listed in student outcomes (SO). In engineering education, one of the aspects that become the competence of Engineering students is the ability to do Engineering Design (ED). Engineering design is a summative ability to identify problems, analyze problems, design solutions, and measure the success of solutions. One way to achieve this capability is to apply the Capstone Project (CP) in the learning delivery. The capstone project provides a multifaceted project that serves as a culminating academic and intellectual experience for students. However, the limitation of credit hours and the uniqueness of each course in a study program implement the Capstone Project challenge. Therefore, the quality of the capstone project will be different between one student to others. This research sees the opportunity of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) to accelerate the engineering design skill by implementing the capstone project in blended learning delivery or as enrichment material. The article proposes an instructional report that shows how to implement a capstone project with the help of MOOC. As a result, it is shown that the xMOOC model can be applied to enriching engineering design skill.

Document texts tend to have noise features or irrelevant features, so that feature selection is needed to overcome the problems. The feature selection is a challenge in sentiment analysis to produce accurate models. It is crucial for improving machine learning algorithms because it can reduce the dimensionality of feature space, remove irrelevant features, select valuable features, and increase learning accuracy. Therefore, this study focuses on reviewing feature selection techniques classified into three categories, such as filter, wrapper, and hybrid methods. The review results concluded that all feature selection techniques could select essential features, reduce the dimensionality of feature space, and improve the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. Filter methods are easy to implement and faster than wrapper and hybrid methods, whereas wrapper methods are better than filter methods in terms of accuracy but slower than filter methods. The hybrid techniques are the best feature selection method to resolve redundant and irrelevant data and increase the classifier's performance. However, hybrid methods are complicated.

In recent years, there has been an increase in research on the internet or social media to find out the sentiments in the review text. Sentiment analysis is a part of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which can help to show whether certain opinions tend to contain positive opinions or negative opinions. In this study, three sentiment polarities were studied using an Indonesian novel review dataset. Data was classified using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach, one of the deep learning methods. To increase success rate, we used pre-trained word embedding to represent words into vectors. The analysis was performed by comparing the word embedding model using GloVe, Word2Vec i.e. Continuous Bag of Words and Skip-gram, and FastText i.e. Continuous Bag of Words and Skip-gram. The experimental results showed that sentiment analysis using the FastText Continuous Bag of Words model reached the highest accuracy of 80% while the Word2Vec Skip-gram model had the lowest accuracy of 78.3%.

As walking is one of the locomotor skills, it is important to evaluating stunting children by their style of walk which refers to a gait. In this present study, twelve normal children and six stunting children with 2 years of age were assessed during gait trials at self-selected speed. Fifty-four gait cycles from three gait trials for all children were selected. Joint angles and angular velocity were computed using 2D video analysis. Statistical analysis was performed to find significant difference on the kinematic parameters between two groups.

Unfortu-nately, previous studies on the identification of cognitive styles were limited to statistical descriptive analysis. The use of eye-tracking was limited merely for validation purposes. In addition, previous studies have yet to apply automatic classification of cognitive style based on eye-tracking data. Hence, this study proposes a method to automatically classify visual-verbal cogni-tive styles based on eye-tracking metrics.

Cryptography is a field of study to keep up the confidentiality of data distributed through networks. In this study, authors conduct image security using the classical cryptography algorithm, Vigenere Cipher, and Affine Cipher, and both Vigenere Cipher and Affine Cipher are implemented in Three-pass Protocol to avoid exchanging keys. It is impossible for the attacker to obtain the key since each sender and recipient keeps the key securely. The purpose of this study is to implement Vigenere Cipher and Affine Cipher in Three-pass Protocol and perform a comparison based on encryption result and execution time at each stage of the Three-pass Protocol. The results show that Affine Cipher in Three-pass Protocol performs encryption better than Vigenere Cipher in Three-pass Protocol in terms of its encryption results.

The objective of this research is to identify the spatial distribution of river response to excessive overland flow on a confined channel. This study was conducted in northwestern part of Katopasa Mountain in Central Celebes, Indonesia. A massive debris flow had been initiated along the unvegetated area near the summit (2 427 m asl), shut down the national route 20 km downstream before hitting the shoreline next to it. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Agent Based Model (ABM) was integrated in order to develop overland flow model. The result showed that raindrops which acted as agent were moving downslope indicating overland flow mechanism within the catchment area. This flow was spatially directed by local slope orientation into a deep confined channel. The accumulation of agents in this channel formed an increased river discharge and flooding area at the outlet of the catchment. This findings would be useful for supporting mitigation strategies.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732799","GIS;ABM;overland flow;Celebes;Indonesia","Graphical models;Protocols;Computational modeling;Redundancy;Transforms;Rivers;Response surface methodology","erosion;floods;geographic information systems;geomorphology;geophysical fluid dynamics;hydrological techniques;hydrology;rain;rivers;sediments;volcanology","GIS;ABM;overland flow model;Central Celebes;Indonesia;overland flows;spatial distribution;geographical studies;debris flows;mountainous areas;lahars;volcanic areas;excessive overland flow;Katopasa Mountain;massive debris flow;unvegetated area;Geographic Information System;flow mechanism;catchment area;increased river discharge;flooding area;size 2.0 m;size 20.0 km","","","","23","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, in this work, we have developed a Software-Defined-PLC transceiver and test-bed that adopts 4, 8 and 16 Quadrature amplitude modulation schemes and uses the Universal Software Radio Peripheral and MATLAB/Simulink platforms to facilitate impulsive noise error measurement and modeling using the three-state Fritchman Markov Model (FMM) and the Baum-Welch Algorithm. The statistical channel models obtained are accurate derived channel models based on experimental measurement. The close match between the experimental and model error-free run distribution and error probabilities justify the modeling of the PLC memory channel using the three-state FMM.

The purpose of this research is to determine the appropriateness of CoR design toward wear rate, wear scars, and surface roughness of artificial lumbar disc model. The wear behaviors of a ball-on-socket (UHMWPE-on-Cp-Ti) artificial lumbar disc were studied under dynamic load (50–150 N) for 1 MC (million cycles). The wear test was done under lateral/bending, flexion/extension, and axial rotation motion for different CoR (7.5, 9, 11, and 13 mm). The wear rates and surface roughness were measured, while the wear scars were observed. The CoR affected the wear behaviors of the artificial lumbar disc. The wear rate of the Cp-Ti socket increases from $0.812\pm 0.078$ to $2.524\pm 0.119$ mm3/MC; on the other hand, the surface roughness decreases from $0.512 \pm 0.039$ to $0.329\pm$ 0.048 μm. Both changes happened along with the increase of CoR from 7.5 to 13 mm. The wear mechanisms of the Cp-Ti socket for different CoR were similar. The dominant wear mechanisms were plowing/scratching and abrasive wear. Hence, the CoR 11 mm is recommended to be applied for a lumbar disc implant.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732796","Wear rate;Center of radius;Surface roughness;Artificial lumbar disc;Titanium","Polyethylene;Sockets;Dynamics;Implants;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Abrasives","abrasion;biomechanics;biomedical materials;bone;orthopaedics;polymers;prosthetics;surface roughness;titanium;wear testing","lumbar spinal disc unit;natural disc;CoR design;wear rate;wear scars;surface roughness;artificial lumbar disc model;wear test;abrasive wear;lumbar disc implant;UHMWPE artificial lumbar disc;center of radius;ball-on-socket artificial lumbar disc;axial rotation motion;plowing;commercial pure titanium;scratching;radius 7.5 mm;radius 9.0 mm;radius 11.0 mm;radius 13.0 mm;Ti","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each ground vehicle is associated with a drone. The first echelon depicts the routes travelled from depot to stopover point and from a stopover point to another stopover point. The first echelon is travelled by a ground vehicle to extend the limitation of drone's range coverage to gather information. The second echelon is the assignment of the drone to the target point. A target point is an area being mapped or in this case that is affected by the disaster. The problem is modelled as an integer linear programming problem denoted as 2EVRP-MOD. It is assumed that drone can only be released from a stopover point. The mapping operation is associated with the amount of area being covered at each target area. The objective is to minimize the total mapping operation time. The entire mapping operation time is limited by the drone flying capacity limit. The model is tested on a real-case dataset in Bekasi, Indonesia.

OAKRIDGE created a project that also responds to the international call of IRID (International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning). The concept is based on the rapid pneumatic transfer of closed capsules that contain debris of corium. This project is now focused on the utilization of developed computing software that can be experimented on the dose rate of corium based on previous works. This software is called PANTHERE. With PANTHERE, we can propose multiple methods of online attenuation calculation with the dose rate (DED H*(10) in mSv/h, KERMA in the air in mGy/h,flux-dose in particles/cm2/s or energy fluencies in MeV/cm2/s). With PANTHERE, we modelized the corium and ran a corium retrieval simulation based on a point of observation to calculate the dose rate of corium inside the capsule inside the BWR Fukushima reactor. After that, we also modelized the trajectory of the capsule from when it is inside the RPV (Reactor Pressure Vessel) until when it is inside the storage system in SFP (Spent Fuel Pool). The highest dose rate given by the calculation was $3.24\times 10^{-3}$ rnSv/h.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732804","Corium modelization;PANTHERE code;Simulation;Fukushima Daiichi;BWR","Analytical models;Atmospheric modeling;Simulation;Pressure vessels;Observers;Software;Trajectory","dosimetry;fission reactor accidents;light water reactors;nuclear engineering computing;nuclear power stations;pressure vessels;radioactive pollution;radioactivity measurement","flux-dose;corium retrieval simulation;BWR Fukushima reactor;highest dose rate;Fukushima-daichi powerplant;PANTHERE codes;Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident;International Research Institute;Nuclear Decommissioning","","","","9","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements as soon as possible after an earthquake are very important because it is an early indication of postseismic deformation. The characteristics of postseismic deformation can be modeled by logarithmic equations with the assumption that the deformations that occur due to the influence of afterslip. In this study, fifteen periodic GNSS data provided by Geodetic Laboratory Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) and four continuous GNSS data provided by Geospatial Information Agency of Indonesia (BIG) were used to determine the velocity and strain rate around the Opak fault. The result showed that the Yogyakarta region especially in the Opak fault area has been deformed with the variying horizontal velocity rate. The stations move to the southeast direction as an effect of the movement of the Eurasian and Indo-Australian plates. Based on the computation of the principal strain using modified least square method, strain rate value in the Opak fault area are less than 1 micro strain/yr with extensional strain is dominated. Some stations especially on continuous stations have decreased of strain values and their standard deviasion after corrected by postseismic parameters in logarithmic functions. It shows that to captured the postseismic deformation would be better to use continuous data.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732854","Opak Fault;GNSS;Postseismic Deformation;Logarithmic Function;Strain Rate","Deformable models;Global navigation satellite system;Seismic measurements;Earthquakes;Estimation;Mathematical models;Geospatial analysis","deformation;earthquakes;faulting;geodesy;Global Positioning System;satellite navigation","strain rate;postseismic correction;2006 Yogyakarta earthquake;Global Navigation Satellite System measurements;early indication;postseismic deformation;deformations;periodic GNSS data;Geodetic Laboratory Universitas Gadjah Mada;continuous GNSS data;Yogyakarta region;Opak fault area;variying horizontal velocity rate;principal strain;rate value;extensional strain;strain values;postseismic parameters;continuous data","","","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this case, the existence of a tropical rainforest is not only directed to stabilize wood supply but also reduce carbon emission in the atmosphere. Estimation of timber production and carbon storage in a tropical rainforest using field inventory requires long-time consuming and high cost. Therefore, an alternative method is proposed to support a more efficient forestry inventory. This study aims to evaluate the potential of remote sensing for facilitating the implementation of forest inventory in a tropical rainforest area. A hybrid approach of remote sensing using two different images resolution, i.e. medium and high was developed to estimate timber production and carbon storage with three predictor variables, namely canopy closure (C), crown diameter (D), and tree density (N). Then, a computational model was constructed from database management systems using a case-based reasoning approach. Results demonstrated that using remote sensing for tropical rainforest inventory provided a good accuracy to estimate timber production and carbon storage with Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) around 18%. This study recorded the mean timber production in the study area was 79.91 m3ha -1 with average carbon storage by approximately 14.33 Mg ha -1. Reviewed from these findings, there was an opportunity to use a hybrid approach of remote sensing for supporting forest inventory in the tropical rainforest.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732844","forest inventory;canopy closure;crown diameter;tree density;case-based reasoning","Image resolution;Estimation;Production;Forestry;Carbon dioxide;Vegetation;Cognition;Climate change","carbon capture and storage;case-based reasoning;climate mitigation;forestry;image resolution;mean square error methods;regression analysis;remote sensing;timber;vegetation;vegetation mapping","hybrid remote sensing;sustainable timber production;tropical rainforests management;carbon emission;forest inventory;tropical rainforest area;hybrid approach;tropical rainforest inventory;mean timber production;average carbon storage","","","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One important biophysical aspect for assessing mangrove degradation is the fractional canopy cover (Fcover), which shows the percentage of the canopy cover over a specified ground area. The location of this research is Bedul Mangrove which is an ecotourism area located in Alas Purwo National Park, East Java, Indonesia. The aim of this study is to estimate and map the mangrove Fcover in the Bedul ecotourism area using Sentinel-2A imagery. A field survey was carried out to measure in-situ mangrove forest canopy using a hemispherical camera. Semi-empirical approach was used for Fcover modeling of Sentinel-2A image. A Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) image was used as a proxy for Fcover modelling from Sentinel-2A. Statistical analysis of correlation and regression was performed to determine the strength, shape, and direction of the relationship between the pairs of Fcover field values and the SAVI pixel values. The modeling result shows that the Fcover ranges from 0 to 0.91 (n: 24). Mangrove canopy cover in this location is dominated by dense canopy cover classes which indicate that the mangrove forest is in good condition.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732876","Mangrove;Fcover;Sentinel-2A;SAVI;Bedul","Degradation;Statistical analysis;Soil measurements;Shape;Estimation;Vegetation mapping;Forestry","forestry;geophysical image processing;remote sensing;soil;statistical analysis;vegetation;vegetation mapping","mangrove fractional canopy cover;imagery;forests degradation;important biophysical aspect;mangrove degradation;specified ground area;Bedul Mangrove;Alas Purwo National Park;mangrove Fcover;Bedul ecotourism area;mangrove forest canopy;Fcover modeling;Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index image;Fcover modelling;Sentinel-2A.;Fcover field values;Mangrove canopy cover;dense canopy cover classes;current 2.0 A","","","","11","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Topological Signatures as Complementary Features for Deep Learning Model: A Survey","B. Rabbani; W. S.

This trend can be explained through the nature of topological signatures which offers a compact description about the shape of data. One of the most used method of topological data analysis is persistent homology. Some studies have suggested that persistent homology could extract features that hardly noticed by other methods. Thus, incorporating persistent homology in machine learning frameworks could give additional information to the model and potentially produce better results. On the other hand, deep learning has shown its remarkable ability to automatically learn features from data. However, it is hard to know what kind of features it may learn and whether there are other useful features which are overlooked by the model. This paper reviews some of the applications of persistent homology in machine learning problems. More specifically, we try to focus on how topological features are exploited along side features which are generated from neural network layers. We systematically analyze the methods used to combine those features and why topological information can be helpful in those problems. The purpose of this study is to summarize evidence about the role of topological features as complementary information to a deep learning model and provide ideas about what kind of problem could benefit from it. We found that data with meaningful spatial relationship and insensitiveness towards tiny fluctuation could take advantage from using persistent homology.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732831","machine learning;topological data analysis;persistent homology","Deep learning;Data analysis;Shape;Perturbation methods;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Market research","data analysis;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","topological signatures;complementary features;deep learning model;topological data analysis;machine learning context;persistent homology;machine learning frameworks;machine learning problems;topological features;topological information","","","","27","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This communication system shares the same resources to two types of user, the cellular users and D2D pair. However, by using same resources, D2D underlaying communication system will increase the interference level among users. To overcome this problem, a good allocation algorithm is needed to allocate Resource Blocks (RB) which used by Cellular User Equipment (CUE) and D2D simultaneously. This work assumes all CUEs will use the RB first. The D2D pairs RB allocation take place after all CUEs get the resource. A modified Joint-Greedy algorithm is proposed to improve D2D pairs RB allocation process. The algorithm consist of two main phase. In the first phase, all D2D pairs will choose the best RB on the system, that being used by the CUE, and take that RB as a candidates. In the second phase, the eNodeB (eNB) will decides which of these candidates that will be allocated to D2D pair by searching the minimum impact of each CUE. From the simulation process, system with underlaying D2D communication can increase the system spectral efficiency system by 30%. Modified Joint-Greedy algorithm allocates can improve spectral efficiency of the system by 3.059% compared with mean-greedy allocation algorithm and 4.33% compared with a conventional greedy algorithm.","","978-1-7281-9472-1","10.1109/ICST50505.2020.9732845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732845","Allocation Algorithm;Joint-Greedy;Underlaying;Device-to-Device","Greedy algorithms;Cellular networks;Spectral efficiency;Interference;Energy efficiency;Device-to-device communication;Resource management","cellular radio;greedy algorithms;radio equipment;telecommunication network management","device-to-device underlaying communication system;modified joint greedy algorithm;mean greedy allocation algorithm;conventional greedy algorithm;system spectral efficiency system;underlaying D2D communication;RB allocation process;D2D pairs RB allocation;CUE;cellular user equipment;resource blocks;D2D underlaying communication system;communication system shares;system data rate;D2D underlaying communications;radio resource management","","1","","10","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This signal formats tested on distance, acceptability, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Q-factor and Bit Error Rate (BER) parameters. From extensive simulations that have been done, the results show that the received power decreased 21.7249 % at the maximum distance. In this condition, the UVLC system produced the BER value of the NRZ format 3.28 × smaller than the RZ format. The SNR minimum that produced BER value less than the threshold for NRZ format is 17.925% smaller than the RZ format. Meanwhile, the minimum Q-factor that produced BER value less than 10−3for NRZ modulation is 6 × smaller than the RZ modulation format.

These devices have been designed to operate at a variety of scales in order to produce short (<100 ns) pulses of ions, X-rays, or neutrons. LLNL has recently constructed and brought into operation a new device, the MJOLNIR (MegaJOuLe Neutron Imaging Radiography) DPF, which is designed for radiography and high yield operations. This device has been commissioned and has achieved neutron yields up to 4E11 neutrons/pulse at 2.2 MA pinch current while operating at up to 1 MJ of stored energy in 2019. The MJOLNIR driver has been upgraded from 1 MJ to 2 MJ stored energy and is expected to achieve 4 MA peak current with this upgrade. First results from shots taken with the upgraded driver will be presented. MJOLNIR is equipped with a wide range of diagnostics, including activation foils, neutron time of flight detectors, a fast framing camera, optical light gates, and a time-gated neutron and x-ray imager. LLNL also runs unique particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations1–3 of DPF discharges in the Chicago code, and has been able to gain significant insight into the various physical factors that influence neutron yield.

With the development of miniature plasmonic signal sources, an tenna and detectors, wireless communication among intra-body nano-devices will be expectedly enabled at both terahertz [2] and optical frequencies[3]. Due to the limited energy and capabilities of nano-devices, it is generally believed that the information could be transmitted in femtosecond-long pulses [4]. Apart from the electromagnetic properties of the biological tissues at the operation band, the pulse shape also has a great effect on the communication performance. Since the path loss sharply increases with the rise of the frequency, thus, it is recommended that the lower band of the THz and optical freq uencies should be adopted. We evaluate the channel capacity for 0.1 ∼ 1THz and received power for 400∼450THz communication inside the layered skin. The transmitted signal power is $1\mu \mathrm{W}$, the duration of the Gaussian pulse is 100 femtosecond, and the standard deviation equals to 10fs. The channel capacity of THz communication inside the skin can be around 5 Gbps when the propagating distance is 1 mm. While in the optical communication, the received signal power at 1mm for the considered optical communication is around −92dBm. The obtained results comparatively quantize the potential of the THz and optical communication inside the human body.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717893","National Defense Science and Technology Innovation Special Zone; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717893","","Integrated optics;Wireless communication;Optical pulse shaping;Biomedical optical imaging;Channel capacity;Optical fiber communication;Skin","biological tissues;biomedical communication;channel capacity;nanocommunication (telecommunication);nanosensors;optical communication;skin;wireless sensor networks","pulse-based intra-body nanocommunication;optical bands;nanotechnology;healthcare technologies;In-vivo wireless nanosensor networks;miniature plasmonic signal sources;detectors;wireless communication;intra-body nanodevices;optical frequencies;femtosecond-long pulses;pulse shape;channel capacity;transmitted signal power;Gaussian pulse;received signal power;optical communication;size 1.0 mm;frequency 1.0 THz;frequency 450.0 THz;power 1.0 muW","","","","4","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An annular electron beam produced by a magnetically insulated co-axial foilless diode is injected into a drift tube of larger radius. In the larger radial tube, the space charge limits the current obtained in the smaller radius region. This leads to the formation of a virtual cathode (VC) near the transition point from where an upstream current flows toward the cathode to reduce the emitted current. In turn, this flow squeezes the beam between the cathode and the radial transition point, that is, the energy of the beam reduces and the charge density increases. Instead of squeezing, the beam between the VC and the cathode can oscillate if even more charge is added into it. To do this, we added a partially transparent screen kept at the same potential as the cathode by a connecting rod. This reflector, placed near the radial transition point, slows down the beam and reflects additional current upstream. A transit time oscillator forms, which emits a weekly oscillating current through the reflector to a nearby collector. When this structure is inside a cavity having a characteristic electro-magnetic frequency in resonance with the beam transit time a monotron type resonance forms which drives the beam to huge current oscillations.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717691","","Time-frequency analysis;Electron beams;Conferences;Magnetic resonance;Space charge;Electron tubes;Plasmas","electron beams;particle beam bunching;space charge","resonant cavity;high-current electron beam bunches;magnetized squeezed state;annular electron beam;magnetically insulated co-axial foilless diode;drift tube;space charge;virtual cathode;upstream current flows;radial transition point;charge density;transit time oscillator forms;weekly oscillating current;beam transit time;current oscillations;periodic bunches;squeezed electron beam;radial tube;electromagnetic frequency;monotron type resonance","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To further magnify the amplitude, a developing technique that using energetic materials ignited by the plasma of microsecond wire explosion has been put forward. To study the plasma material interaction, we investigated the mixture powders of ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate and aluminum in two mass formulas (A: 45%AN/40%AP/15%Al, B: 65%An/25%Ap/15%Al) which were ignited by exploding tungsten wire (diameter 0.3 mm and length 60 mm). Results showed that the shock wave pressure waveforms of different formulas were quite similar. When the charge mass was 30 g, the area impulse of the shock wave generated by the B load was $15.7 \text{MPa}\cdot \mu \mathrm{s}$ larger than that of the A load, while the peak pressure was only 0.35 MPa lower than that of the A load. Since the explosion heat of AN was −365.5 kJ/mol, and that of AP was −293.72 kJ/mol, assuming that the reactants react completely, the volume of gas produced per unit mass of AN would be 1.19 times that of AP, and the explosion heat would be 1.83 times that of the latter. Therefore, the B formula with higher AN mass fraction was more powerful. Moreover, as the mass of the charge increases, the area impulse showed a certain increase but gradually saturated. This is probably because with the mixture powders gradually compacting, the internal air gap was reduced, and the reaction tended to a negative oxygen balance. Therefore, the reaction failed to proceed to the final decomposition product. Finally, a simple AN/AP/Al load mass and formula scheme suitable for microsecond exploding wire plasma was proposed.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717875","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51907089); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20190421); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M671673); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717875","","Heating systems;Shock waves;Powders;Conferences;Wires;Aluminum;Air gaps","aluminium;exploding wires;explosions;mixtures;plasma applications;powders;shock waves","energetic materials;mixture powders;ammonium nitrate;ammonium perchlorate;shock wave pressure waveforms;charge mass;explosion heat;high pulsed power technology;electrical explosion;underwater shock waves;microsecond exploding tungsten wire plasma;mass fraction;pressure 15.7 MPa;pressure 0.35 MPa;Al","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By introducing materials into the gap of the split-ring resonator, it may be possible to not only further intensify the electric fields and therefore the plasma breakdown, but also to modify the material through intense electric fields and plasma exposure. Since the volume of the split-ring resonator gap is very small, the material in the gap will also have a relatively high volume to surface area ratio. Therefore, it may be possible to modify such materials with minimal thermal loading.

The use of such a spent electron beam seems promising for the implementation of sources of broadband noise-like microwave oscillations of an average power level (10–100 W). We propose an original scheme of a hybrid device consisting of a traveling wave tube (TWT) and a low-voltage vircator. A hybrid microwave device consists of a TWT, a drift pipe located immediately after the output of energy (low-voltage vircator), with measuring probe and a collector, the potential of which can vary widely. The results of an experimental study of the parameters of broadband noise-like generation of a low-voltage vircator using a spent electron beam at the exit from the interaction space of a TWT were obtained. The results of the study of the energy and spectral characteristics of the proposed device are shown. Experimental studies were carried out with help of a collapsible vacuum installation in a pulsed mode (pulse duration τ = 50 μs, duty cycle Q = 1000)2. All elements of the proposed device under study were placed in the same evacuation research chamber of a collapsible vacuum unit. The calculation of the efficiency of the investigated device was carried out. The main parameters of the spent electron beam based oscillator are as follows: accelerating voltage 4.2 kV, beam current 130 mA, output integrated power 60 W, electronic efficiency 11%, operating frequency band 1–3 GHz. Thus, the carried-out studies have shown that the use of a spent electron beam with a large electron spread in longitudinal velocities leads to the generation of broadband noise-like oscillations. Also, it was shown that it is possible to implement various multifunctional systems in one hybrid device: a mono signal amplifier based on a TWT and an oscillator of middle power noise-like signals.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717509","","Microwave measurement;Low voltage;Electron beams;Broadband amplifiers;Traveling wave tubes;Microwave oscillators;Hybrid power systems","electron beams;klystrons;microwave amplifiers;microwave oscillators;noise;oscillations;travelling wave amplifiers;vircators;wideband amplifiers","traveling wave tube;TWT;hybrid microwave device;spent electron beam based oscillator;broadband noise-like microwave oscillations;spent electron beams;low-voltage vircator;klystrons;electron velocity spread;drift pipe;broadband noise-like generation;collapsible vacuum installation;pulsed mode;monosignal amplifier;middle power noise-like signals;power 100.0 W;time 50.0 mus;voltage 4.2 kV;current 130.0 mA;power 60.0 W;frequency 1.0 GHz to 3.0 GHz","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Lagrangian scheme includes the Coulomb force which affects the dynamics of larger particles. In contrast, the nodal method treats the nanoparticles for which the charge effect is negligible. As the number of nanoparticles is much larger than that of microparticles, the nodal method is also beneficial to reduce the computational time. This method helps understand the particle dynamics and the growth mechanism of microparticle and nanoparticle mixture observed in the experiment.

Here, we present our work on acoustic interrogation of a femtosecond filament with a visible plasma channel length of 1cm generated using 300 mm focusing lens. The spatial structure of filament comprises of a series of periodic breakdown plasma regions, which emit acoustic waves proportional to plasma intensity into the ambient air3. An amplified calibrated microphone and an optical fiber coupled USB spectrometer were used to perform an acoustic and optical scan of the entire spatial extent of the filament. As we scan the microphone from the start to end of the filament, we observe that the acoustic peak pressures rise till the center then decreases. The maximum acoustic peak pressure at the center of the filament is 2.3 kPa (161 dB). From optical scan of the filament, the optical emission spectrum is obtained along the length of the filament, which helps in estimating the plasma electron density4, which is ~ 18.6×1016 cm−3. The acoustic and optical emission scans help us in precisely mapping the spatial extent and the intensity profile of the filament plasma channel. We also calculated the acoustic spectral composition from the time domain pulses and observed that the acoustic central peak frequency is 120 kHz at middle of the filament, and changes to 60 kHz at the beginning and end of the filament, indicating a change in plasma properties along the length of the filament.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717489","","Integrated optics;Stimulated emission;Focusing;Electron optics;Universal Serial Bus;Acoustics;Plasmas","acoustic wave propagation;air;calibration;electron density;optical focusing;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma light propagation;plasma production by laser","femtosecond filament;quasistatic light filaments;acoustic scan;optical scan;acoustic emission scans;optical emission scans;filament plasma channel","","","","4","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays Nonlinear Transmission Lines - NLTL has been studied to generate waves on ultrahigh-frequency in the terahertz range2, The frequency, voltage modulation depth - VMD, power, and number of oscillations are the main parameters to be analyzed for the design of these devices. In this work, we propose a new configuration to improve the VMD using more than one LPNLTL connected to a load, named as shock wave configuration. The simulation was made by using the LT-Spice software. The results with a single line produced an RF signal with a frequency of the order of 36.4 MHz, VMD near to 9.4 V, and the number of oscillations equal to 8. In the simulation using a shock wave configuration with six lines, the VMD increased to 13.7 V, which means 45.7% higher than VMD produced with a single line. The oscillation peaks remained unchanged under the shock wave configuration and the frequency has a little increase going of the 36.4 MHz (single line) to 40 MHz, which means 9.9% higher using shock wave configuration. A MOSFET amplifier was used to increase the RF signal produced by the shock wave configuration, reaching a VMD of the order of 80 V. This technique shows that VMD is increased when RF is produced by an LPNLTL using the shock wave configuration, which can widen the cover range of the signal.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717555","","Radio frequency;Varactors;Shock waves;Power transmission lines;RF signals;Satellite broadcasting;Voltage","modulators;MOSFET;oscillations;radiofrequency amplifiers;shock waves;SPICE;transmission lines;varactors;waveguides","shock wave configuration;voltage modulation depth;nonlinear transmission lines;low power nonlinear transmission lines;LPNLTL;varactor diode;ultrahigh-frequency generation;terahertz range frequency;VMD;oscillations nunber;LT-Spice software;MOSFET amplifier;voltage 9.4 V;voltage 13.7 V;voltage 80.0 V;frequency 36.4 MHz to 40 MHz","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently years, cylindrical confocal waveguide has been demonstrated to be a qualified beam-wave interaction structure for gyrotron traveling wave amplifiers (gyro-TWA). A series of 140 GHz confocal gyro- TWAs have been developed in Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1,2 and successfully applied into the application of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) enhanced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Based on the electron cyclotron maser (ECM) principle and the local field expansion method, the fully numerical linear and nonlinear theory for a gyro-TWA with arbitrary cross section waveguide have been developed in this paper. The linear and nonlinear gain in a 0.22 THz confocal gyro-TWA was investigated by using this theory. To suppress the backward- wave oscillations (BWOs), a multi-section interaction circuit with optical loss severs was proposed and analyzed. The calculation results suggest that the optical sever can significant suppress the self-oscillations but has little effects on the forward wave amplification. Finally, it is indicated that the 220GHz amplifier consists of three sections separated by two severs could produce saturation power of 46.7kW with a gain of 32 dB and a 3-dB band of 4.8 GHz.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717508","","Integrated optics;Spectroscopy;Polarization;Optical polarization;Stimulated emission;Gyrotrons;Optical saturation","circular waveguides;cyclotron masers;gyrotrons;optical losses;oscillations;travelling wave amplifiers","gyrotron traveling wave amplifier;quasioptical confocal cylindrical waveguide;high frequency gyrotron design;cylindrical confocal waveguide;beam-wave interaction structure;local field expansion method;nonlinear theory;nonlinear gain;multisection interaction circuit;optical loss severs;forward wave amplification;TWA;dynamic nuclear polarization;DNP;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy;NMR spectroscopy;electron cyclotron maser principle;ECM;numerical linear theory;backward wave oscillations suppression;BWO;self-oscillations suppression;frequency 0.22 THz;frequency 220.0 GHz;power 46.7 kW;gain 32.0 dB;bandwidth 4.8 GHz","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The differing energy dependence of the Zr and Be activation cross-sections enables an effective neutron energy ${E_{\mathrm{n}}}^{\text{eff}}$ to be inferred from the Zr/Be count ratio for individual PF shots. For the fast-neutron activation detector geometry, the relationship between the Zr/Be count ratio and ${E_{\mathrm{n}}}^{\text{eff}}$ is established by MCNP5 simulation. Zirconium and beryllium detector pairs are positioned at 0° and 90° to the PF axis, so that the anisotropy of the neutron energy is measured from shot to shot. The NX3 PF is operated at 12 kV, corresponding to 7.2 kJ capacitor bank energy. Shots are performed for D2 gas pressures ranging from 1.5 to 10 mbar. The highest neutron yields of ∼109 neutron/shot are observed for 5 mbar D2 gas pressure. Typical effective neutron energies ${E_{\mathrm{n}}}^{\text{eff}}$ for the 0° and 90° directions are ∼2.8 MeV and ∼2.5 MeV, respectively, and the neutron energy-anisotropy remains close to $\Delta E_{\mathrm{n}}\cong 0.3\ \text{MeV}$ over the range of D2 gas pressures investigated. The effect of blocking the forward fast-deuteron beam with an obstacle plate positioned in front of the PF anode is also studied. For this case, shots are performed for D2 gas pressures ranging from 1 to 6 mbar. Insertion of the beam-obstacle plate results in a large reduction in neutron yield, while the effective neutron energy ${E_{\mathrm{n}}}^{\text{eff}}$ increases for both the 0° and 90° directions. The results indicate that DD fusion contributions from thermonuclear or gyrating-particle processes are negligible. The collected results are entirely consistent with beam-target fusion being the dominant mechanism within the plasma pinch and throughout an extended cone on the forward (0°) axis of the NX3 PF.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717809","","Geometry;Deuterium;Zirconium;Energy measurement;Detectors;Beryllium;Neutrons","beryllium;deuterium;plasma diagnostics;plasma focus;plasma simulation;zirconium","deuterium gas;activation cross-sections;MCNP5 simulation;plasma focus axis;capacitor bank energy;neutron yields;gas pressure;effective neutron energies;neutron energy-anisotropy;fast-deuteron beam;beryllium fast-neutron activation detectors;DD fusion neutron emission;zirconium fast-neutron activation detectors;plasma focus anode;NX3 plasma focus device;effective neutron energy;beam-obstacle plate;pressure 1.5 mbar to 10.0 mbar;pressure 1.0 mbar to 6.0 mbar;voltage 12.0 kV;energy 7.2 kJ;Zr;Be","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Plasma was produced in an indigenously made compact size ECR plasma source1, 2, (dia: 0.09 m, length: 0.11 m) located coaxially within an NdFeB ring magnet assembly, placed at the center of the top dome of the plasma chamber. The magnetic field inside the source generates the ECR zone to permit absorption of the incoming microwave at 2.45 GHz for plasma heating, and extends as a diverging field into the large chamber. Plasma from the source flows along magnetic field to form a beam–like column near the source. Langmuir probe measurements along the chamber axis ($z$) at pressures 1–3 mTorr and input power 400 W show that the plasma density ($n_{e}$) decays rapidly up to $z=20\ \text{cm}$ from the source mouth ($\mathrm{z}=0$) followed by a slow decay thereafter towards the bottom of the chamber. The initial decay profile tracks the axial magnetic field profile closely confirming the $n/B$ scaling obeyed by hydrogen plasma as observed earlier in a smaller vessel3. Radial measurements taken at different $z$ planes show good radial uniformity away from the source. At $z=70\ \text{cm}, n_{e}\approx 3.5-4.0\times 10^{10}\ \text{cm}^{-3}$ and $T_{e}\approx 1-2\ \text{eV}$ over 40 cm radius at ≈ 3 mTorr pressure and 400 W power.

The dispersion characteristics and coupling impedance of the ML-SWS calculated with the theory are in good agreement with those obtained by HFSS code, in which the relative error between them is under 7%. The effects of the metal shield and the thickness variation on dispersion of the ML-SWS can be considered with the theoretical model. The overlapping and crossing of adjacent modes were discussed for investigating the effects of adjacent modes on high frequency characteristics due to the variation of the structure size and mode order number, which show that the band gap of the dispersions may disappear when two half-period structures are symmetrical to each other for the adjacent two slow wave modes or the thickness of the ML is increased to some value for a fast wave mode and a slow wave mode.

We study an electropositive argon discharge, weakly electronegative oxygen discharge and highly electronegative chlorine discharge at operating pressure of 10 mTorr and 50 mTorr for driving frequencies of 13.56 and 27.12 MHz. We apply the 1d-3v particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision code oopd1 for the study. For the argon discharge the electron heating appears mainly in the sheath region while the chlorine discharge exhibits significant drift-ambipolar electron heating contribution within the electronegative core [1]. At 10 mTorr the oxygen discharge shows significant contribution from drift- ambipolar heating within the electronegative core at 13.56 MHz while the electron heating appears only in the sheath regions at 27.12 MHz and at 50 mTorr stochasting electron heating in the sheath region dominates.

The oxygen discharge is detachment dominated while the chlorine discharge is ion-ion recombination dominated and this has a significant influence on the discharge properties.

Commercial finite element codes are unable to solve the electromagnetic aspects of a launch using a transient solver in 3-D due to the aforementioned challenges. However, 2-D approximation suits well to model VSE even with commercial software. Such approximation overestimates VSE resistance due to the error comes from the assumption of infinitely high rail height. In this study, we used a quasi- transient 3-D FEM model where the conductivity of the air- armature region is varied to emulate the movement of the armature to invest the accuracy of the 2-D approximation. Results have shown that using 2-D approximation, the VSE resistance is overestimated by nearly 40%.

The balancing interplay of the intensity dependent Kerr self-focusing, and plasma induced defocusing, leads to a soliton like propagation of energy confined within a periodic plasma channel which is called a filament1. The onset of this phenomenon can be accelerated by using focusing optics which minimizes the distance and pulse energy requirement at which the filament generation is initiated. The generation of filament allows us to clamp the beam spot size and intensity over long distance of propagation which is very desirable for LIDAR applications. Any spatial or temporal distortion of the focused femtosecond laser beam due to the focusing elements has serious implications on the shape and intensity of the filament produced. Here, we present the results of our study on the effects of aberrations associated with different focusing elements on the nature of filament generated. We used both transmitting optics (achromat, thin and thick plano-convex lens) and Reflective optics (Off-axis parabolic mirror (OAPM)). Of these focusing elements the OAPM has the least aberrations (Spherical, chromatic and GDD induced) and thick lens has the most. We measured the atomic emissions from the filament and the supercontinuum generated using a USB spectrometer and the spatial extent using a CCD and DSLR camera. Based on the spectral measurements we estimated the peak filament intensities2 and GDD induced by each optical element. The surprising observation was that the thick lens with the most aberrations performed on par with the OAPM to produce the most intense filament. The thick lens had another advantage where the spatial extent of the filament (length and width) was also large compared to that of the OAPM. In applications like LIBS or white light LIDAR where one looks for strong emissions from the filament (large emission profile), the filament generated from the thick lens becomes highly desirable.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717634","","Atomic measurements;Laser radar;Focusing;Optical distortion;Optical variables measurement;Plasmas;Ultrafast optics","aberrations;high-speed optical techniques;laser beams;laser materials processing;lenses;mirrors;optical design techniques;optical focusing;optical Kerr effect;optical radar;optical self-focusing;plasma density;plasma light propagation;self-focusing;supercontinuum generation","aberrations;femtosecond filaments;intense femtosecond pulses;atmosphere leads;ionized plasma channel;optical pulse;Kerr mediated self-focusing;on-axis intensity;intensity dependent Kerr self-focusing;plasma induced defocusing;periodic plasma channel;focusing optics;pulse energy requirement;filament generation;beam spot size;focused femtosecond laser beam;different focusing elements;transmitting optics;OAPM;peak filament intensities;optical element;lens;intense filament","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An optimization study was done for the following materials: Al, Ag, Mo, and Ti by changing the gap distance between the two conical electrodes. Different diameters were used in order to keep the mass per unit length the same. It appears that 0.5-1.5 mm gap was satisfactory to assure a single micropinch from a 300 kA, 50 ns rise time current pulse on the XP pulsed power generator. In addition, a time optimization study was carried on Ti wires, more than 50% of the shots produced X-rays at a consistent time. Time consistency was achieved by varying the gap distance and changing the wire diameter. It was found that smaller diameter wires with larger electrode gap distances were more consistent.

From the theoretical point of view, they represent a transition between the physics of the rf capacitively coupled discharges and the dc magnetron discharges. However, unlike their better-known counterparts, the rf magnetrons are less studied. In the present work we use an implicit energy-conserving 2d3v PIC/MCC code to model an rf magnetron investigated experimentally at the Ruhr University Bochum. Under assumptions of the axial symmetry and the insignificance of instabilities (indicated by experimental observations for the chosen operating regime), the simulations were conducted in r-z cylindrical geometry. The results demonstrated the importance of realistic reactor geometry representation in the code (including, e.g., the reactor side chamber) to achieve a good agreement with experimentally measured values of the dc self-bias, which was carried out with a strongly non-uniform mapped computational grid resolving the areas where essential phenomena were expected. Special emphasis in the present work was put on studying the rf modulated electron dynamics, which was strongly non-uniform due to the magnetron static magnetic field, featuring areas of inhibited transport across the magnetic field lines above the racetrack and CCP-like sheath phenomena where the magnetic field lines were almost perpendicular to the target. The rich electron power absorption dynamics obtained in the simulations could be explained by an interplay of such phenomena as the electric field reversal during the sheath collapse, influence of the ambipolar electric field, energization of the ion-induced secondary electrons by the sheath voltage, energetic electron beam generation by the sheath expansion for weak magnetic fields, and ohmic heating. The excitation dynamics provided by the simulations agreed reasonably well with the corresponding experimental observations.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717869","","Radio frequency;Geometry;Magnetic field measurement;Codes;Discharges (electric);Numerical models;Magnetic fields","high-frequency discharges;magnetrons;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;secondary electron emission","realistic reactor geometry representation;magnetron static magnetic field;magnetic field lines;RF magnetron discharges;RF modulated electron dynamics;ion-induced secondary electrons;sheath voltage;energetic electron beam generation;sheath expansion;ohmic heating;excitation dynamics;electron power absorption dynamics","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Plasma parameters were measured using an on-axis Langmuir Probe. The CEPS uses NdFeB ring magnets with a complex field structure that has a magnetic mirror trap near the ECR zone followed by an on-axis magnetic null within the source region, and a monotonically decreasing field in the expansion chamber. Typically, at ≈ 600 W microwave power (2.45 GHz), 0.3–2 mTorr hydrogen pressure, the plasma density $n\approx 10^{10}\ \text{cm}^{-3}$ and electron temperature $T_{\mathrm{e}}\approx 25\ \ \text{eV}$ in the expansion chamber near the source, while further downstream $n$ and $T_{\mathrm{e}}$ are reduced to ≈ 109 cm−3 and 5 eV, respectively2. However, for 3–10 mTorr the plasma contains two electron populations - a high density, cold, bulk population and a low-density, warm population ($n_{w}/n\approx 0.01;\ T_{w}/T_{e}\approx 10$). Another feature observed at the higher pressures is that $T_{\mathrm{e}}$ cools to less than 1 eV about ≈ 30 cm from the source mouth. Such low $T_{\mathrm{e}}$ bulk electrons are important for generation of H− ions by the volume production mode, which may be preferred over the caesiated grid method due to maintenance issues associated with the latter3. An interesting feature of the plasma is that the normalized plasma density and magnetic field profiles overlap fairly accurately indicating very little cross-field transport of the hydrogen plasma. In general, one finds from the experiments that the nature of the CEPS magnetic field is such as to promote efficient electron heating and high $T_{\mathrm{e}}$, which are not desirable for volume production of H− ions. To achieve the latter, another field configuration that eliminates the adverse effects of the magnetic mirror and the null has been set up and results from the latter configuration will be presented at the conference.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717797","","Magnetic field measurement;Hydrogen;Sociology;Production;Ions;Plasmas;Mirrors","cyclotron resonance;hydrogen;ion sources;Langmuir probes;magnetic mirrors;permanent magnets;plasma density;plasma radiofrequency heating;plasma sources;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes","source region;monotonically decreasing field;expansion chamber;electron populations;cold population;bulk population;low-density;source mouth;e bulk electrons;volume production mode;normalized plasma density;magnetic field profiles;cross-field transport;hydrogen plasma production;CEPS magnetic field;efficient electron heating;compact ECR source;efficient volume generation;compact ECR plasma source;plasma parameters;NdFeB ring magnets;complex field structure;magnetic mirror trap;ECR zone;on-axis magnetic null;hydrogen pressure;on-axis Langmuir probe;size 50.0 cm;size 75.0 cm;power 600.0 W;frequency 2.45 GHz;electron volt energy 25.0 eV;electron volt energy 1.0 eV;size 30.0 cm;pressure 2.0 mtorr;electron volt energy 5.0 eV;pressure 3 mtorr to 10 mtorr;H-","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, conventional based-tube RF generation requires vacuum and heating filament, which consumes space and power. In our research, it is envisaged the use of nonlinear transmission lines (NLTLs) to replace the RF tubes in several applications as these new devices are all solid-state. For instance, lumped NLTLs can be used in the disruption of battlefield communications and drone telecommands as well in SAR radars for image remote sensing. There are two types of NLTLs: lumped lines with at least one nonlinear component (L or C) and nondispersive continuous ferrite loaded lines biased by an external axial magnetic field, known as gyromagnetic. With lumped NLTLs, our ongoing experiments have shown the operation of these devices at 300 MHz, using SiC Schottky diodes with a pair of DRG antennas for propagation1. With gyromagnetic lines, the recent results have demonstrated that these lines can also operate in the lower band range2 (200 MHz). For future tests, it is expected that these lines will reach operation frequencies up to 1.5 GHz using permanent magnets for compact space applications.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717685","FAPESP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717685","","Radio frequency;Schottky diodes;Radar remote sensing;Power transmission lines;Silicon carbide;Gyromagnetism;Radar imaging","coaxial cables;ferrites;magnetic fields;permanent magnets;Schottky diodes;silicon compounds;transmission lines","permanent magnets;SAR radars;heating filament;based-tube RF generation;nonconventional technique;research status;compact space applications;gyromagnetic lines;external axial magnetic field;nondispersive continuous ferrite loaded lines;nonlinear component;lumped lines;image remote sensing;drone telecommands;battlefield communications;lumped NLTLs;nonlinear transmission lines;frequency 300.0 MHz;frequency 200.0 MHz;SiC","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The DT fuel density reaches about a thousand times the solid density. The fuel implosion uniformity requirement is stringent, and the implosion acceleration non-uniformity should be less than a few %. The phase-controlled non-uniformity is realized in the HIF fuel target implosion by the wobbling heavy ion beams (HIBs), and the implosion non-uniformity is successfully mitigated in HIF. In plasmas it would be difficult to measure the non-uniformity phase and amplitude.

In experiments at the University of New Mexico (UNM) a conversion efficiency of >60% was measured in experiment until the cathode endcap flashed over, after which the efficiency dropped to below 40% [1]. Since these experiments the UNM group predicted similar efficiencies for an MDO powered using a virtual cathode [2]. The proposed advantage of operating the MDO with a virtual cathode as opposed to a physical cathode was the elimination of pulse shortening via AK gap closure. Finally, more recent work suggests that the use of a magnetic mirror to suppress axial leakage current can lead to maximal efficiency of an MDO driven by a virtual cathode [3]–[5]. This presentation will provide the latest experimental results on these subjects.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717657","ONR(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2155); AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-19-1-0225); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717657","","Diffraction;Atmospheric measurements;Conferences;Predictive models;Particle measurements;Plasmas;Power conversion","cathodes;leakage currents;magnetic mirrors;magnetrons;relativistic electron beams","relativistic magnetron with diffraction output;MDO;particle-in-cell simulations;electron beam-to-microwave power conversion efficiency;cathode endcap;UNM group;virtual cathode;physical cathode;relativistic MDO;PIC simulations;magnetic mirror;axial leakage current","","","","5","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And under different certain conditions, the electromagnetic radiation is relevant to a variety of novel mechanism. Firstly, the concept of plasma-based multistage virtual cathode radiation in beam-plasma system has been proposed. The formation of the virtual cathode is implemented, which shows that the virtual cathode is formed by a self-focusing relativistic electron beam, and the parametric regions of forming the virtual cathode are found[1]. Secondly, the THz electromagnetic radiation in beam-plasma system is investigated, and Cherenkov radiation is considered to be the mechanism of this study[2]. The electromagnetic radiation in radially non-uniform beam-plasma system also provide a clue that the beam-plasma system could produce THz electromagnetic radiation[3]. Thirdly, in an overdense plasma, high harmonic THz electromagnetic radiation could be excited by the interaction between plasma and a long electron beam, which leads to the resonance between the electron beam and the plasma wakefield[4]. Another scheme to generate high harmonic THz electromagnetic radiation is to take the self-modulation of the electron beam as a mode selection method. The self-modulation in transverse direction is to produce plasma wakefield and in the longitudinal direction the plasma wakefield will compress the bunches. The coupling of the harmonics of the modulated beam and the corresponding eigenmodes could result in the THz electromagnetic radiation[5]. Finally, some experiment results will be given.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717461","","Couplings;Electron beams;Conferences;Electromagnetic radiation;Harmonic analysis;Ions;Plasmas","Cherenkov radiation;electron beams;plasma accelerators;plasma density;plasma electromagnetic wave propagation;plasma light propagation;plasma simulation;plasma-beam interactions;relativistic electron beams;wakefield accelerators","thz radiation;ion focused beam-plasma system;relativistic electron beam;plasma-based multistage virtual cathode radiation;THz electromagnetic radiation;Cherenkov radiation;nonuniform beam-plasma system;overdense plasma;long electron beam;plasma wakefield","","","","5","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

NP properties such as size, composition, and luminescence can be tuned by adjusting plasma operating parameters, including pressure, gas flow rate, gas composition, and power deposition [1]. Previous work has shown that charging of the NPs plays an important role in NP characteristics due to its consequences for NP transport, heating and chemical reactivity. Computationally representing these dependencies in multi-dimensional models has been difficult due to the charge state (positive, negative or neutral) depending on the size and location (through plasmas properties) of the NP. For nanometer size particles, potentials and charges can be estimated using the Orbital Motion Limited Theory, though this model may overestimate the particle charge for larger sizes, and does not account for the statistical nature of charging of nanometer-sized particles. In this work we computationally investigate silicon NP synthesis on the reactor scale in a flowing, low pressure plasma sustained in Ar/SiH4. The Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM) [2], a 2D reactor scale multi-physics model was used to track NP growth and charge fluctuations. Improvements to the HPEM, including algorithms accounting for particle growth, nucleation, agglomeration and charging will be discussed. Results for trends in silicon NP growth and charging as functions of operating parameters such as pressure and power deposition will be discussed.

The current is produced in an arrangement of three electrodes (a triode) consisting of an accelerating voltage gap followed by a decelerating gap. The cathode is required to emit an electron beam below the SCL limit of the accelerating gap. Thus, when the beam is not fully decelerated in the decelerating gap, it does not oscillate as it would in a reflex triode. This finite low energy electron beam flows into a third consecutive gap, which is considered to be the diode. When the current injected into the diode exceeds its SCL for a sufficiently low diode voltage, a virtual cathode forms and the beam self-oscillate at a frequency determined by the time-of-flight (TOF) of the electrons in the triode.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717606","","Time-frequency analysis;Electron beams;Conferences;Voltage;Space charge;Plasmas;Particle beam injection","cathodes;diodes;electrodes;electron beams;space charge;triodes;vircators","TOF;electrons time-of-flight;low diode voltage;third consecutive gap;finite low energy electron beam flows;electron beam;space charge self-oscillations generation;space-charge limit;current amplitude;virtual cathode forms;reflex triode;accelerating gap;SCL limit;decelerating gap;vacuum diode","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high inductance (607 nH) and associated high voltage (640 kV) and fast rise time $(1.2 \mu \mathrm{s})$ of Hawk are unusual for a DPF driver, as is the initialization of the DPF using local injection of neutral gas and plasma into a vacuum chamber, rather than a conventional neutral gas fill. This method of initialization allows for the selection of an extensive array of initial conditions.

Understanding the transport of these relativistic electrons through solids is central to many areas in laser-driven plasmas and their translational research, ranging from laser-driven fusion to the production of micro-accelerators for industrial and medical applications. In particular, the “transit time” of these relativistic electrons through the material - i.e. the duration of their lifetime inside the solid - is an important parameter that determines the efficiency of energy transfer to the lattice. For example this is critical for determining the efficacy of laser-driven particle sources for therapeutic applications. However, due to the inaccessibility of the side-products from this interaction, very little is known about the time the electrons spend inside a solid and no reliable methods exist to delineate this information. We have recently shown that “real-time” measurements of the transition of relativistic electrons through a solid dielectric can be obtained by monitoring their Cherenkov emission through an ultrafast-laser-driven Kerr-gate. The Kerr-gate provides an ultrafast shutter-speed camera to freeze-frame the electron motion inside the material, yielding invaluable information about their dynamics and lifetime inside solids1.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717662","","Translational research;Dynamics;Surface emitting lasers;Production;Solids;Particle measurements;Real-time systems","high-speed optical techniques;optical Kerr effect;plasma light propagation;plasma production by laser","transit time;relativistic electrons;laser-driven particle sources;therapeutic applications;solid dielectric;ultrafast-laser-driven Kerr-gate;ultrafast shutter-speed camera;electron motion;unraveling laser-driven ultrafast plasma dynamics;intense femtosecond lasers;solid surface;ultrashort pulses;near-light speeds;megaampere currents;solid material;laser-driven plasmas;translational research;laser-driven fusion;microaccelerators;industrial applications;medical applications","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, a 3-D Zakharov-Kuznetsov-Burgers (Z-K-B) equation is derived from the pair of ion continuity and momentum equation with bulk viscosity among ion fluids, and degenerate electrons and positrons. The effect of mass of pair of ions, positron concentration, magnetic field strength and the Fermi temperature of weakly relativistic and ultra-relativistic degenerate electrons and positrons are studied in the present work. The Burgers term in our system is responsible for shock structures in pair ion plasmas. Analytical prediction and numerical analysis enable us to know that the wave yields solitary profile in absence of collisions and exhibits both oscillatory and monotonic depending on collisions between pair of ions and balanced status of diisipation and dispersion. Moreover, it is exhibited that the chaotic dynamics occur when the perturbed Z-K-B equation is perturbed by external force, and we use power spectrum, phase projection, and Lyapunov exponents to observe both weak and developed chaos.

Optical spectroscopic tools such as emission, absorption, and fluorescence have the potential to perform in-field, rapid, and non-contact actinide analysis. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy which employs emission spectroscopy of laser-produced plasma was previously used for U plasma analysis including isotopic detection.1 However, the use of emission-based spectroscopic tools for actinide analysis is always challenging considering the extremely congested spectra of all actinides including U and Pu. For example, there exist nearly 100,000 transitions in the UV-VIS spectral range for uranium neutrals and singly ionized species. In addition to these, the emission spectroscopic tools are constrained by instrumental broadening which dictates the available spectral resolution. In this context, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and laser-absorption spectroscopy (LAS) are useful tools for obtaining high-resolution spectral features, linewidths, isotopic shifts and hyperfine structures.

With the development of accelerator technologies around the world, there has been a growing interest in the generation of THz radiation driven by a linear accelerator (LINAC). The crucial part in the generation of the tunable THz radiation is the production of microbunched electron beams with picosecond (ps) and sub-ps periodicity. A long electron beam propagating through a plasma channel can be modulated and divided into a train of microbunches, with the periodicity defined by the plasma frequency. We proposed a method of microbunched beam conditioning to allow Smith-Purcell THz radiation generation. The great advantage of the beam plasma modulation is its simplicity, as the microbunch periodicity can be tuned by changing the gas pressure in a plasma capillary and thus the plasma density and plasma frequency. We show that this approach has the potential to generate coherent and tunable THz radiation.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717623","","Frequency modulation;Electron beams;Terahertz radiation;Production;Linear particle accelerator;Plasmas;Information and communication technology","electron beams;free electron lasers;linear accelerators;microwave photonics;particle beam bunching;plasma density;plasma-beam interactions;submillimetre wave generation;terahertz wave generation","beam plasma modulation;microbunch periodicity;plasma capillary;plasma density;plasma frequency;coherent tunable terahertz radiation;plasma modulated electron beams;linear accelerator;microbunched electron;sub-ps periodicity;plasma channel;microbunched beam conditioning;Smith-Purcell THz radiation generation","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we present a reformulation of the global model equations using numerical methods that approximately capture these spatial dependencies. Plasma quantities are expressed in terms of rational functional representations with undetermined coefficients. Least-squares weighted residual methods are then applied to the ensuing global model equations to determine these coefficients in a way that minimizes various norms (L2, L-inf, etc.).

Machining tolerances and surface roughness are the important parameters for the propagation of RF signal and can considerably effect the characteristics performance of the vacuum tube [3]–[4]. In this paper a beam wave interaction structure for W-Band frequency has been fabricated in two halves by wire EDM micro fabrication technique and then both the parts were integrated to form a staggered double vane structure. An extensive study of SEM results of the fabricated structure accounts for the dimensional deviation of 10 microns. The interaction structure has a tapered region to ensure low impedance mismatch and better coupling with the WR-10 waveguide ports of VNA. Consequently, the fabricated structure was used to perform the cold test analysis. A waveguide casing was fabricated in accordance with dimensions of WR-10 waveguide for cold test analysis.

One of the interesting ways of utilizing RONS is via the plasma-treated water (PTW) because PTW effectively maintains a large amount of RONS and relevant intermediates for a long post-discharge period. While applying PTW containing RONS for applications, identifying the key chemical species and their kinetics is a prerequisite because they strongly depend on application systems [1]. In this presentation, our numerical code developed to obtain spatiotemporal distribution of RONS in a plasma-water system will be discussed. The code calculates RONS concentration in the 1D gas and liquid model from the 0D plasma global model with Boltzmann equation solver (BOLSIG+), to calculate mean electron energy and mobility [2], [3]. In the model, the decomposition reaction of chemical species by photons, i.e. photolysis, was included to predict how chemical products change depending on the spectrum and intensity of UV light source. The result shows that the concentrations of O3, H2O2, and NOx are higher than other species in the entire gas region, and O3, H2O2, and NO3− concentrations are higher than other species in the liquid region. hydroxyl radical (OH) and nitric oxide (NO) and other radicals in the plasma region generated these species by reactions with the electron, ions, and radicals.

Specifically, we look at two MITL geometries with loads, namely a radial MITL and a MITL with a spherical bend. We model and compare the electric fields and electron flow for these two cases using analytical/numerical methods and the code EMPIRE developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The analytical field calculations allow for a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian approach while the simulations of particle trajectories accurately model gyro-motion of electrons. Qualitatively, we find that at distances far from the load, the particle's motion is largely due to ExB drift motion towards the load. Close to the load, however, the particle's motion is largely due to grad B drift with possible ExB drift enhancement due to a MITL bend.

For this reason, the improved performance of circuit breaker is required. However, arc is generated between electrodes with interrupting the current. Furthermore, the transient recovery voltage is applied from the power supply after the current is cut off. These physical phenomena are on the order of milliseconds to microseconds. Thus, arc becomes non-equilibrium. It is reported that the thermal non-equilibrium is remarkable in the post arc. This is because the electron is more easily accelerated by the electric field than heavy particle. The electron number density increases with increasing the electron temperature. The increase in electron number density is the cause of re-striking. Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the increase in electron number density with increasing the electron and heavy particle temperature in order to improve the performance of circuit breaker. However, few reports have researched the electron and heavy particle temperature with the transient recovery voltage. This is because it is difficult to measure the microsecond temperature and the low brightness temperature in the post arc. As a countermeasure, the 3-D electromagnetic thermal fluid simulation under consideration of thermal non-equilibrium is useful. In this research, the electron and heavy particle temperature with the transient recovery voltage were calculated using the 3-D electromagnetic thermal fluid simulation. The energy conservation equations for electron and heavy particle were discretized by simulating a three-dimensional space. As a result, the electron temperature increased with increasing the transient recovery voltage. On the other hand, the heavy particle temperature increased from the energy transfer from electron to heavy particle.

Measurements are conducted using the electric field induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) laser diagnostic technique1. With this non-intrusive technique, high temporal (sub-ns) and spatial resolution results can be obtained. In this experiment, a picosecond Nd:YAG laser is employed and the EFISH signal is collected with a photomultiplier. The burner features a pin-to-pin electrode configuration. A methane-air flame is established in the 10-mm electrode gap and NRP discharges in the glow regime2 can develop across the gap. The experimental configuration and the post-processing have been carefully selected to better resolve the steep gradients formed in this non-homogeneous field. Calibrations against Laplacian fields allow the quantification of the electric field in the fresh gases before the flame front.

Employing RF power (instead of the conventional DC power) allows to deposit not only electrically conductive materials but also dielectrics like optical coatings or semiconductors. In this work two different approaches are used to study the discharge numerically which is otherwise investigated experimentally. An implicit energy-conserving 2d3v PIC/MCC code in rz-geometry simulates the plasma spatially and temporally resolved. Global parameters like the voltage drop in the bulk region and in the magnetized zone, currents to the surfaces, and the bias voltage are extracted from this simulation. These parameters are used to improve a lumped element model. This model is an extension of a previously published lumped circuit description of unmagnetized RF discharges1. As its predecessor, the discharge is represented by separate bulk, and sheath zones and in addition a new magnetized zone which are linked via Kirchhoff relations. The model is efficient in terms of computation time, it only needs a fraction of the time compared to the PIC simulation. Nevertheless, it can be used to gain a fundamental understanding of the discharge. It was successfully used to identify the origin of the Magnetic Asymmetry Effect in a previous work2. With help of the global parameters extracted from the PIC simulations the length of each zone can be determined. The current voltage behavior in the magnetized zone can be fitted, too, to have a suitable description. Due to the magnetic field structure there are sheath areas at the powered electrode where electrons reach the electrode. This information can be gained from the simulation as well and used for the lumped element model. The results of the improved lumped circuit model pertaining to the electron dynamics, plasma series resonance and power dissipation are verified against the results of the PIC simulations.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717847","German Physical Society (DFG); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717847","","Radio frequency;Magnetic separation;Computational modeling;Magnetic resonance;Voltage;Discharges (electric);Plasmas","elemental semiconductors;high-frequency discharges;lumped parameter networks;plasma collision processes;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;plasma-wall interactions;sputter deposition","lumped element model;radio frequeny magnetron discharge;magnetron sputtering;employing RF power;conventional DC power;electrically conductive materials;optical coatings;semiconductors;work two different approaches;rz-geometry simulates;global parameters;voltage drop;magnetized zone;bias voltage;published lumped circuit description;unmagnetized RF discharges;sheath zones;PIC simulation;Magnetic Asymmetry Effect;current voltage behavior;magnetic field structure;powered electrode;improved lumped circuit model","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Birdsall Award speaker, I will focus on technical challenges that have highlighted my career since 1964. In my earliest days, I studied kinetic effects in sound propagation. Particles can run ahead of fluid waves, sending forth a precursor signal. Later, I studied high altitude explosions in the earth's ionosphere that could lead to ion-acoustic, and magneto-sonic plasma shocks controlled by the earth's magnetic field. In 1972 breakeven with laser fusion seemed an imminent possibility — 8 years away. At Los Alamos I co-authored the first PRL on DT micro-balloon implosions driven by sharply rising laser pulses. Longer wavelength laser beams ($10.6\mu$) were found to produce copious hot electrons, drastically reducing implosion efficiency, and were then modeled by slow, explicit PIC codes. In 1981 with the new Implicit Moment Method I found that a co-set of fluid equations could be solved implicitly to generally predict net electron behavior using a time step far exceeding the electron Courant Condition. This greatly facilitated 2D studies of hot electrons, previously impeding straight-forward laser target implosions. In the later 80s the Sandia Laboratory and the Naval Research Laboratory were considering pulse power systems to implode targets. Energy flow to these targets was controlled by Plasma Opening Switches. We found that the Implicit Moment Method greatly facilitated the modeling of these switches. In the 90s we returned to making comprehensive studies of ICF target behavior with Los Alamos and Livermore target codes, supplemented by Implicit Moment hot electron modeling. Although I retired from Los Alamos in late 2005, I continued to explore implicit and ICF modeling issues, showing with coworkers in 2014 - at our Research Applications Corporation - that kinetics could be used to improve shock-viscosity modeling in ICF codes.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717876","","Codes;Fluids;Electric shock;Laser modes;Mathematical models;Plasmas;Kinetic theory","explosions;laser fusion;plasma pressure;plasma shock waves;plasma simulation;viscosity","PIC codes;implicit moment method;fluid equations;net electron behavior;electron Courant Condition;straight-forward laser target implosions;pulse power systems;plasma opening switches;ICF target;Livermore target codes;shock-viscosity modeling;collisionless shocks;laser fusion implosions;Birdsall Award speaker;kinetic effects;sound propagation;fluid waves;magneto-sonic plasma shocks;magnetic field;DT microballoon implosions;laser pulses;copious hot electrons;ion-acoustic plasma shocks;implicit moment hot electron modeling;ICF modeling","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pulsed current conducts energy through the arc plasma in the air gap, forming an instantaneous power deposition in the air gap. Different from the electrical contact in hundred-ampere-level, when the maximum power of the load device reaches up to several GW, and the peak current increases to hundreds of kiloampere, the “thermal erosion” and “shock force” of the arc plasma in the air gap are significantly enhanced. The high-energy arc plasma damages the electrode surface, and causes it to be eroded, sublimated, and sputtered. This study introduces the damage characteristics of different alloy materials under arc plasma. The extreme discharge condition with the peak current of 100kA is set. Compare the surface ablation of the cathode and anode in four commonly used electrode materials: tungsten copper, chromium copper, alloy steel, and aluminum oxide dispersion strengthened copper alloys (ODSC). The results show that the “fluidized” phenomenon is most obvious in ODSC, which is closely related to the shock wave of the plasma boundary. At the same time, the average mass loss of ODSC is also the largest. On the contrary, the tungsten copper electrode has the most uniform ablation on the macroscopic appearance. In regard to roughness of the surface. The alloy steel is in a “semi-spattered” state under the thermodynamic effect of the plasma with the current of 100 kA, that is, the metal droplets adhere to the electrode surface in a detached manner from the SEM result, t, making the roughness extremely large. The relative mass loss rate of chromium copper is the same as that of tungsten copper. However, due to the higher density, the absolute mass loss is slightly larger than that of tungsten copper electrode. Combined with the thermodynamic analysis of plasma under the condition of pulsed current, for 100kA pulsed arc, alloy steel and ODSC have some disadvantages in melting characteristics, but the performance of tungsten copper alloy is relatively stable. If the current further increases, chromium copper alloys may have greater potential.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717599","","Electrodes;Thermodynamics;Surface waves;Air gaps;Tungsten;Copper alloys;Chromium","alloy steel;arcs (electric);chromium alloys;circuit-breaking arcs;copper alloys;discharges (electric);electrical contacts;electrochemical electrodes;melting;plasma materials processing;scanning electron microscopy;surface roughness;tungsten alloys","current conducts energy;instantaneous power deposition;electrode surface;surface ablation;alloy steel;plasma boundary;tungsten copper electrode;tungsten copper alloy;chromium copper alloys;alloy electrodes;arc interruption;energy arc plasma;gas gap switches;electrical contact;thermal erosion;shock force;sputtering;aluminum oxide dispersion strengthened copper alloys;surface roughness;thermodynamic effect;metal droplets;scanning electron microscopy;WCu;CrCu","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the high energy electrons that are generated by high voltage pulses, they are capable of the very efficient production of highly reactive radical species and energetic photons. These products can consequently react with, for instance, particles in gas streams (e.g. pollutants, odor and dust), contamination in water. Typically, pulsed discharges consist of the primary streamer and the secondary streamer discharges phases. The tip of primary streamer discharge, which is called the streamer head, is paramount important for highly efficient radical production. In the recent study, a nanosecond (ns) pulsed power generator with a pulse duration of 5 ns has developed at Kumamoto University and then it has confirmed that ns pulsed discharge method has higher treatment efficiency than that of general pulsed discharge methods because the main discharge phase is primary streamer characterized by smaller heat loss. However, the propagation mechanism of a real-time ns pulsed streamer head is not understood yet. The study of streamer dynamics is of crucial importance for the elaboration of various applications of nonthermal plasmas produced by ns pulsed discharge. In the present study, a high-speed imaging system combined with four emICCD cameras was uniquely implemented at Kumamoto University, enabling to capture a real-time four continuous images of ns pulsed streamer. In the experiment, relationships between velocity and diameter of the streamer heads in a coaxial electrode were simultaneously investigated with the four emICCD cameras. As a result, the ns pulsed streamer head propagated with an acceleration between the electrodes, and furthermore the streamer head diameter increased significantly during its propagation. This can be explained from the effect of a significantly fast pulse rise rate peculiar to ns pulse voltage exceeding 10 kV/ns.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717664","","Electrodes;Head;Production;Voltage;Streaming media;Cameras;Real-time systems","discharges (electric);electrodes;plasma diagnostics;plasma transport processes","velocity-diameter relation;nanosecond pulsed streamer head;coaxial electrode;nonthermal plasma;streamer discharges;Kumamoto University;streamer dynamics;high-speed imaging system;nanosecond pulse voltage;emICCD cameras;time 5.0 ns;pressure 1.0 atm","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Industry 4.0 refers to the concept of factories in which machines are augmented with wireless connectivity and sensors, and in a broader sense to development of production processes that are compatible with the major concept. The compatibility is assured in practical cases only where the processes are reliable enough and any deviations from prescribed parameters manageable. Furthermore, the applied technological processes should be compatible with major trends and policies such as environmental sustainability, low carbon footprint etc. Plasma technologies are among technologies that have been recognized as key enabling technologies in several EU regions including Slovenia. Traditional plasma reactors are often “black boxes” with adjustable and traceable discharge parameters (like type of discharge, voltage and current, types of gases and their flows etc.) but plasma parameters (fluxes of reactive species onto the products upon plasma treatment, temperatures of reactive species and products, etc.) are not monitored. In order to meet standards of Industry 4.0, plasma reactors will have to be equipped with numerous sensors integrated into a smart control system. There is hardly any correlation between discharge and plasma parameters in industrial reactors employing complex gases. Several examples of spatial and/or temporal variation of plasma parameters at constant discharge parameters will be presented. Such variations should be managed by smart production lines according to Industry 4.0. The problem is manageable only upon installing numerous sensors into plasma reactors. These sensors should monitor at least the energy fluxes onto the surface of treated materials, but preferably also the fluxes of different reactive species. The latter is currently regarded impossible for industrial size reactors due to the lack of appropriate sensors. The development of reliable and inexpensive sensors of plasma radicals therefore represents a major challenge for plasma scientists.

Radial and axial laser shadowgraphy and interferometry platforms are set up to observe the dynamics from different direction simultaneously. To solve the problem that inside plasma density of liner cannot be absolutely calibrated due to the lack of zero plasma density area, we established a new CW laser interference system which can trace the change of interferce lines. Consequently, we study the inside precursor of the exploding liner. It is found that the density of the precursor is very low (∼1e-6g/cm3) and velocity is very high (∼150 km/s). It accumulates at center resulting in a high density column at center. According to the voltage mearsurements and consequent derived inductance change, there is about 10–20 % total the current locating at center precursor plasma column while the main part of the liner keeps stationary. The perturbations development at outside surface are investigated through transverse laser shadow image. Perturbations are first observed at 300 ns after current start.

On the other hand, the development of spacecraft thrusters has seen a tremendous growth over just a few decades. Although traditional chemical propulsion is still widely employed in space flights, it cannot meet the more challenging requirements of deep space travel due to its low specific impulse. The advent of electric thrusters has helped humans travel further from Earth and has the potential to be developed for interstellar flights. In addition, electrodeless thrusters do not suffer from electrode corrosion, as with presently operational electric thrusters. This work is attempting to utilize rotamak technology in a plasma engine to accomplish a novel type of thruster with high specific impulse2. We have assessed the potential of a rotamak-type system as a small electrodeless thruster.

Furthermore, it is known to generate various kinds of chemically active species, therefore its application field is wide as water treatment, ozone generation, exhaust gas decomposition etc. However, different applications require different kinds of chemically active species, then, the chemically active species are generated by electrons having different electron energies. Thus, it is possible to improve plasma processing efficiency by measuring the accurate electron temperature of the generated pulsed streamer discharge. Laser Thomson scattering diagnostics (LTS) is considered to be a reliable method to measure electron temperature and density in plasma. So far, it has been used mainly for measuring arc discharge and glow discharge. In the LTS, it is necessary to apply a laser to the discharge. In case of arc and glow discharge, the discharge is stable between anode and cathode electrodes, therefore, laser irradiation is relatively easy. On the other hand, in case of streamer discharge, since the discharge branches and the position of streamer head changes irregularly, it is necessary to control both the discharge itself and laser irradiation timing on a fine scale both temporally and spatially. Therefore, measuring pulsed streamer discharge using LTS diagnostics is a challenging topic. In this study, propagation progress of the pulsed streamer discharge at a needle-to-cone electrode geometry was observed with an ICCD camera, and the characteristics of the streamer discharge were investigated. In addition, LTS diagnostics was performed to clarify characteristics of the streamer discharge. In the LTS measurement, a positive high voltage was applied to the needle electrode to generate a streamer discharge between the electrodes, a laser was irradiated just below the anode needle, and the scattered light that has passed through the spectroscope was photographed with an ICCD camera. We succeeded in obtaining Thomson scattering under high pressure He gas and other gas species. The electron temperature and electron density of the pulsed streamer discharge were measured.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717474","","Temperature measurement;Pulse measurements;Density measurement;Measurement by laser beam;Scattering;Plasma measurements;Discharges (electric)","arcs (electric);electrodes;electron density;glow discharges;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma materials processing;plasma temperature","accurate electron temperature;generated pulsed streamer discharge;arc discharge;glow discharge;discharge branches;streamer head changes;LTS diagnostics;positive pulsed streamer discharge plasma;high pressure gas;laser Thomson scattering diagnostics;non thermal equilibrium plasma;gas temperature;discharge area;chemically active species;different electron energies;electron temperature measurement;electron density measurement;non- thermal equilibrium plasma;plasma processing efficiency;He","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the immature development of high-performance room temperature terahertz detectors and sources, terahertz technology is still far from full exploitation. Herein, a photothermoelectric (PTE) THz photodetector made of NbS3 is reported. The device shows a considerable performance in THz band. The photoresponsivity is as large as 1.2 VW−1 while the response time is only 7 ms, much shorter than the reported THz photodetectors of the same channel scale, such as silicon-based heterojunction1, millimetric scale graphene2 and ternary chalcogenide single crystal3. The extraordinary performance is fully discussed and can be attributed to the thermal localization enhanced PTE effect. Due to the short thermal decay length and low thermal loss, the heat generated by the illumination is localized in only a micrometer scale along the channel and thus a strong PTE response is produced. In addition, the fabricated device also demonstrates robust flexibility and outstanding stability in air. Thanks to the quasi-one-dimensional structure, the NbS3 crystal is easy to be scaled down for nanodevices and thus intrinsically facilitate the integration of detector. With these favorable merits, the quasi-one-dimensional NbS3 crystal holds promising potential for high-performance, flexible and THz photodection.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717925","","Performance evaluation;Location awareness;Detectors;Crystals;Terahertz materials;Photodetectors;Stability analysis","elemental semiconductors;graphene;niobium compounds;optical materials;photodetectors;photoelectricity;photothermal effects;silicon;terahertz wave detectors;terahertz wave spectra;thermoelectricity","thermal localization enhanced terahertz photothermoelectric response;channel scale;silicon-based heterojunction;millimetric scale graphene;ternary chalcogenide single crystal;thermal decay length;thermal loss;quasione-dimensional crystal structure;photothermoelectric terahertz photodetector;thermal localization enhanced PTE effect;illumination;time 7.0 ms;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;NBS3;Si;C","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While nuclear fusion has been widely touted as the holy grail2 of clean, sustainable energy, the little advances3 since the 1940s has been few and far in between, despite the tremendous efforts and funding that has been put into it. A more feasible alternative clean energy resource has thus been postulated, which involves harvesting the abundant solar energy that irradiates the Earth every second. One way to harvest this energy resource without needing to utilize it immediately nor cause any further environmental damage in its harvesting or usage, is to directly use the solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen4. Since 1972, scientists all over the world has been researching materials that can achieve this and one such compound have been identified as tritantalum penta-nitride (Ta3N5)5. Herein, we present a TRIM (TRansport of Ions in Matter) simulation of the synthesis of Ta3N5 based on Monte Carlo calculations. The phase and nanostructure of the photocatalyst resulting from this plasma-based synthesis is presented as well.

To study the DBD in atmospheric air, a one-dimension fluid model is presented in this paper, which uses a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen to simulate the air environment. The model is used to numerically investigate the influences of the amplitude and frequency of sinusoidal AC voltage on the dielectric barrier discharge characteristics. The voltage amplitude range from 9 kV to 15kV, and the voltage frequency range from 8 kHz to 12 kHz. The results clearly show that the DBD in atmospheric air is strongly affected by the amplitude and frequency of applied voltage. The average electron volume density reaches 1017/m3, which is consistent with the experimental value of atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge. In addition, when the applied voltage frequency is 10kHz, obvious discharge current peaks can be observed at 11kV, and the discharge current shows single peak every half cycle as well as apparent positive and negative asymmetry. The amplitude of discharge current peaks varies from tens of milliamps to a few amperes with a pulse width of hundreds of nanoseconds. However, if the frequency of the applied voltage is reduced, multiple peaks can be observed in each cycle of discharge current. Furthermore, this paper also studies their influence on the electric field strength of the air gap, the surface charge of the dielectric, and the distribution of charged particles in the discharge region. Finally, the formation mechanism of multi-peak discharge current is analyzed.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717431","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51907089); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20190421); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M671673); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717431","","Surface discharges;Atmospheric modeling;Voltage;Discharges (electric);Etching;Numerical models;Plasmas","dielectric-barrier discharges;electron density;gas mixtures;nitrogen;oxygen;plasma density;plasma simulation;plasma temperature","air gap;discharge region;multipeak discharge current;atmospheric pressure air dielectric barrier discharge;material surface treatment;plasma etching;ozone synthesis;electron density;one-dimension fluid model;air environment;sinusoidal AC voltage;voltage amplitude;average electron volume density;applied voltage frequency;environmental protection;electron temperature;electric field strength;apparent positive asymmetry;apparent negative asymmetry;pressure 1.0 atm;frequency 10.0 kHz;voltage 11.0 kV;voltage 9.0 kV to 15.0 kV;frequency 8.0 kHz to 12.0 kHz;N2-O2","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the well-known methods of operation frequency increasing is the operation at the higher harmonics. Such an approach is used, for example, in gyrotrons. It is expedient to apply such a method to increase the operation frequency in low-voltage oscillators with non-laminar electron beams (low-voltage vircators). These devices can be used as compact nonrelativistic microwave sources with relatively low output power1. Earlier2 we have shown some preliminarily first results of higher harmonics generation in low-voltage vircator system with the nonlaminar electron beam. In this work, we consider the results of the detailed theoretical and experimental study of the structure of spatially localized clusters of space charge in low-voltage vircators. Studies have revealed that to generate higher harmonics in the spectrum of the output signal, it is necessary to form electron bunches of a quasi-hollow shape with a ratio of the current density in the center to the current density at the periphery of 0.1-0.2. The mentioned above structure of the clusters can be formed as a result of applying a magnetic periodic focusing system with a non-sinusoidal distribution of induction in the longitudinal direction. Moreover, the size of the region with the maximum current density in electron bunches should be from 10 to 30 percent of the longitudinal size of the bunch itself, and the distance between the peaks of the current density of the bunch of the space charge should be approximately equal to the width of the peak. The results of the harmonic analysis of spatiotemporal bunches in the non-laminar electron beams are also presented. It was shown that in order to increase the number and amplitude of higher harmonics in the spectrum of the output signal of low-voltage vircator, it is necessary to form a space-charge bunch consisting of 10–15 partial quasi-hollow sub-bunches. In this case, the number of harmonics that are observed in the spectrum of the output signal reaches 15–16.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717886","Russian Foundation for Basic Research(grant numbers:19-02-00757); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717886","","Low voltage;Electron beams;Shape;Space charge;Harmonic analysis;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave oscillators","current density;electron beams;gyrotrons;harmonic analysis;microwave generation;microwave tubes;particle beam bunching;space charge;vacuum microelectronics;vircators","spatially localized clusters;space charge;nonlaminar electron beams;modern vacuum microwave electronics;operation frequency increasing;low-voltage oscillators;relatively low output power;higher harmonics generation;low-voltage vircator system;nonlaminar electron beam;output signal;electron bunches;current density;space-charge bunch consisting","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A microwave works by passing radio waves at a frequency of 2.45 GHz through any insect. Microwaves at this frequency have an interesting property: they are absorbed by water and fats. When absorbed, the water or fat molecules start rotating due to the alternating nature of the electric fields of the microwave. This atomic motion is directly converted into energy which is given out as heat that destroys the insects. Thus, live testing of microwave treatment has been carried out successfully on maggots growing on the night-blooming jasmine tree and found very effective outcomes.

Shocks are generated in the medium due to balance of different kinds of effects such as nonlinear, dispersive and dissipation effects. Shocks have potential applications for acceleration of charged particles in different kinds of plasma environments. The present work focuses on the study of ion-acoustic shock waves in magnetized quantum plasmas with the effects of spin-up and spin-down degenerate electrons. The spin effects are considered as one of the most important properties of quantum plasmas due to great significance of highly magnetized quantum plasmas in the atmospheres of neutron stars. A theoretical investigation has been carried out to study the propagation of shock waves with the density effects of spin-up and spin-down electrons. We have considered quantum plasma in which a uniform magnetic field is applied along positive z-direction. The separated spin evolution quantum hydrodynamics model (QHD) has been used by considering spin-up and spin-down electrons as different species. The Zakharov-Kuznetsov-Burgers (ZKB) equation has been derived by employing reductive perturbation method.3 The effects of density polarization ratio and different plasma parameters on the characteristics of IA shocks have been analyzed. It is seen that spin density polarization ratio significantly affects the characteristics of IA shock waves as we move from strongly spin polarized case to zero spin polarized case. The results obtained in the present investigation may be useful in comprehending various nonlinear excitations in dense astrophysical regions such as, white dwarfs, neutron stars.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717819","","Plasma properties;Shock waves;Magnetic separation;Electric shock;Atmospheric modeling;Perturbation methods;Neutrons","astrophysical plasma;dusty plasmas;hydrodynamics;neutron stars;plasma density;plasma electrostatic waves;plasma ion acoustic waves;plasma kinetic theory;plasma nonlinear waves;plasma shock waves;plasma solitons;relativistic plasmas;white dwarfs","ion-acoustic shock waves;magnetized dense quantum plasmas;nanoscale electrochemical systems;dense astrophysical plasmas;neutron stars;white dwarfs;extremely high number densities;charge particle;nonlinear effects;dispersive effects;dissipation effects;charged particles;plasma environments;spin effects;quantum plasma;highly magnetized quantum plasmas;density effects;spin-down electrons;uniform magnetic field;plasma parameters;spin density polarization ratio;IA shock waves;zero spin polarized case;dense astrophysical regions;spin evolution quantum hydrodynamics model","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The resulting redistribution of the plasma electrons modifies the optical properties of the plasma in nonlinear fashion and thus affects the propagation characteristic of the laser beam. The formulation is based on finding the semi analytical solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger wave equation (NLSE) governing the evolution of laser beams in nonlinear media.

Slough","MSNW LLC, WA, USA","2020 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)","25 Feb 2022","2020","","","463","463","Rapid missions to the outer planetary bodies require a large change in vehicle velocity upon arrival to establish stable orbits. The total required velocity change can be on the order of 10s of km/s, thus a large fraction of the spacecraft mass must be fuel, thereby limiting useful payload. Virtually all planetary bodies have an atmosphere sufficient to provide for deceleration from aerodrag. Employing a solid deflector for orbit insertion has been successful in the past, but due to frictional heating and unknown changes in atmospheric conditions, the braking must be distributed over many elliptical orbital passes into the atmosphere to achieve the required braking. The concept to be presented is the deployment of a coil set that produces a dipolar magnetic field that is then filled with plasma to provide the necessary impediment to atmospheric flow and thereby produce the desired drag. (see illustration below). It is referred to as a Plasma MagnetoShell (PMS). The advantages of PMS are many. Frictional heating is no longer a concern. The aeroshell is now composed of massless magnetic field and plasma. The scale of the magnetic barrier can be as large as desired (∼ 10–100 m), and requires less than a gram of plasma. While the dipole coil will the dominant mass, it is negligible compared to the spacecraft. With the ability to rapidly control the drag by changing field strength or plasma density, the larger braking force required for aerocapture is now feasible. The primary drag-inducing interactions between the magnetically confined ions and the neutral atmospheric particles are that of charge exchange and elastic scattering. During the interaction the neutral momentum is imparted to the magnetized ion which is then reacted onto the magnetic coils tethered to the spacecraft. A laboratory scale PMS capable of testing in LEO has been designed, built and tested. Test results and the conditions that must be satisfied for the PMS to provide the desired aerobraking on a large spacecraft will be presented.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717904","NASA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717904","","Space vehicles;Heating systems;Magnetic confinement;Magnetoelasticity;Drag;Ions;Plasmas","braking;celestial mechanics;drag;planetary atmospheres;space vehicles","magnetic coils;aerobraking;outer planetary bodies;vehicle velocity;stable orbits;total required velocity change;spacecraft mass;solid deflector;orbit insertion;frictional heating;elliptical orbital;coil set;dipolar magnetic field;atmospheric flow;desired drag;Plasma MagnetoShell;massless magnetic field;magnetic barrier;dipole coil;dominant mass;braking force;primary drag-inducing interactions;magnetically confined ions;neutral atmospheric particles;magnetized ion;Plasma Magneto-Shell Aerocapture","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This could be useful in the food processing industry where microbial contamination of food contact surfaces are a source of foodborne illness. Single linear plasma discharge devices lack the spatial coverage that an array of discharges offers, and common plasma jet arrays require dithering or other means of movement to cover the same area. Our group has developed a CAP array assembled from multiple linear discharges that can be used to inactivate bacterial biofilms over large treatment areas. Each linear discharge consists of 2 opposing metal electrodes ($24\ \text{mm}\times 1\ \text{mm}$) buried below $125\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ of Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC). The gap between electrodes is $750\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. These devices operate with an AC voltage (0.5-2 kV), an Argon gas flow (3–13 LPM), and a typical discharge current from a single element of 1–2 mA. To form arrays of discharge elements, stacks of linear discharge elements containing two opposing embedded electrodes are assembled. To ensure uniformity of the discharge elements, we have tested external ballast resistances of 1, 100, 200 $\mathrm{k}\Omega$, and demonstrated the importance of resistances between 100 $\mathrm{k}\Omega$ and 200 $\mathrm{k}\Omega$ on discharge uniformity. In a different configuration, internal ballast resistors are used. The HV AC electrodes can then share a common electrical connection so that only 2 wires are needed to drive the array elements in parallel. Internal ballast resistors, fabricated using a DuPont thick film resistor paste, are used to create $\approx 150\ \mathrm{k}\Omega$ resistors on the ground side of each discharge element embedded within the LTCC substrate. An 8 element discharge array has been demonstrated with an area of $29\ \text{mm}\times 15\ \text{mm}$. The devices are designed for modularity when adding additional discharge elements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these devices in inactivating common foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms (E. coli, Pseudomonas, etc) in biofilms formed on steel, glass, and plastic substrates.

However, even in THz bands, advanced modulation formats would be required as well as in conventional millimeter-wave or microwave bands, to increase spectral efficiency. Spectral efficiency and transmission capacity of THz communication systems will be reviewed in this presentation. We will share a survey result on power consumption of short-distance wireless systems. Power consumption reduction in radio transmitters is also very important to reduce operation cost of networks. The result implies that THz high-speed radio may provide effective transmission. However, the transmission distance of THz transmission should be shorter than a few hundred meters due to attenuation in the air. Thus, we should construct the THz networks consisting of many THz radio-links and optical fibers, which are connected by many media converters. We will discuss issues in such seamless networks. To offer a real-time THz transmission, the Horizon 2020 EU-Japan project ThoR (“TeraHertz end-to-end wireless systems supporting ultra high data Rate applications”) will develop an over 100 Gb/s radio transmission system using frequency band beyond 275 GHz [2].

Depending on the materials of the wall, boundary condition of the neutral and charged particles in plasma is changed due to different loss probabilities on the surface. De-excitation process on the metal and insulator walls is known for one of the loss mechanisms of Ar metastable species by tunneling of excited electrons between metastable and solid wall surface.1 This study used de-excitation reaction of the metastable species near the wall as an indicator of wall material state. Optical emission spectroscopy(OES) was used to measure Ar emission spectrums to deduce characteristics of metastable species. Among the Ar emission lines emitted from collisional-radiative processes of various excited atoms, the lines of the transitions from 2p to 1s energy levels were chosen because these lines had strong intensity enough to analysis. The line-ratio value with the intensity of the 811 nm and 750 nm Ar lines(I811nm/I750nm) was especially used to calculate metastable concentration due to its sensitivity to metastable species. Experiments were conducted in argon capacitively coupled plasma source with the pressure of 5 ∼ 50 mTorr and RF power of 100 ∼ 500 W. Materials of stainless steel and aluminum oxide(Al2O3) were used to simulate metal and insulator coated wall in process chamber. The results show that the line-ratio of I811nm/I750nm was larger on the Al2O3 wall than on the stainless steel wall with coinciding with larger de-excitation probability of metal than that of insulator wall following metastable density changes. Based on the results, the investigation of the wall condition monitoring on the wall with changing status will be presented. This study could be applied to develop sensor for monitoring process drift caused by changing wall condition.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717724","National Fusion Research Institute of Korea (NFRI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717724","","Radio frequency;Sensitivity;Stimulated emission;Optical variables measurement;Tunneling;Insulators;Solids","argon;condition monitoring;high-frequency discharges;Langmuir probes;metastable states;plasma collision processes;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma materials processing;plasma simulation;plasma sources;plasma temperature;plasma-wall interactions;sputter etching","wall conditioning state;AR plasma emission;process plasma chamber;plasma properties;inducing process;subtle state change;boundary condition;different loss probabilities;De-excitation process;insulator walls;argon metastable species;excited electrons;metastable wall surface;solid wall surface;de-excitation reaction;wall material state;argon emission spectra;argon emission lines;collisional-radiative processes;excited atoms;line-ratio value;750 nm;metastable concentration;argon capacitively coupled plasma source;insulator coated wall;process chamber;stainless steel wall;insulator wall;metastable density changes;wall condition monitoring;monitoring process drift;changing wall condition;power 500.0 W;pressure 5 mtorr to 50 mtorr;Ar","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We employed an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) to increase the surface hardness of SKD11 die steel. The H2/N2 mixture gas was used as the nitriding gas for plasma nitriding process. Materials characteristics by Vickers hardness tester, optical microscope, and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) were employed. The optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was used to detect the optical emission of plasma species from atmospheric pressure plasma jet. The pristine SKD11 die steel represented a hardness of $558\pm 5.9\text{HV}_{0.3}$, while plasma nitriding process apparently increased to reach the value around $1095\pm 15.5$ HV0.3. The hardness enhancement was believed to be contributed from the self-growth of the nitride layer and diffusion layer with a total thickness of $45\ \mu \mathrm{m}$ above the matrix within 17 min analyzed by optical microscope. We also proposed that the accumulated heat induced by plasma bombardment under H2/N2 mixture gas in an APPJ system was obtained, in which give a substrate temperature around 500°C detected by the thermal couple offering suitable nitriding temperature. Additionally, from OES observation, the NH radicals were the key species to control the hardening mechanism of SKD11 die steel, as well as the exposure time and substrate temperatures. Based on the thermochemical case hardening process using H2/N2-APPJ system, the improved surface hardness can be used to promote high resistance to wear, scuffing, galling and seizure. Plasma nitriding process is implemented in typical applications in the manufacturing industries such as gears, valve parts, pressure-die-casting tools, forging dies, moulds, and engine parts. We also believed that plasma nitriding using H2/N2 mixture gas in an APPJ system is a modern thermochemical treatment for offering short time operation on the nitridation of steel objects.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717749","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China(grant numbers:MOST 109-2221-E-011-087-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717749","","Integrated optics;Optical diffraction;Plasma jets;Stimulated emission;Surface resistance;Plasmas;Steel","abrasion;casting;crystal microstructure;forging;microhardness;nitridation;optical microscopy;plasma jets;plasma materials processing;surface hardening;thermochemistry;tool steel;Vickers hardness;wear resistance;X-ray diffraction","Vickers hardness tester;optical emission spectroscopy;diffusion layer;plasma bombardment;mixture gas;surface hardness;pressure-die-casting tools;nitridation;plasma nitriding SKD11 die steel;wear resistance;abrasion;anticorrosion;X-ray diffractometer;thermochemical case hardening;galling;scuffing;seizure;forging dies;moulds;microstructure;pressure 1.0 atm;temperature 500.0 degC;time 17.0 min","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Laser-induced fluorescence is employed to measure t he time development of OH and NO radical density distributi on during the pulse duration and the inter-pulse period. It is s hown that convection caused by ion wind due to electro hydr odynamic force enhances and dominates the transport of OH radicals from the surface plasma layer to the afterglow region with a distance up to 8 mm away from the dielectric surface. Interestingly, after the plasma switches off, OH density decre ases quickly near the electrode but the downstream distributi on region keeps constant, showing that the impact of convecti on is still present during the post-discharge. Additionally, the propagation velocity of OH declines monotonously with time. The maximum value is estimated as 1.86 m/s during the first 1 ms when the plasma is on. The influence of power delivere d to plasma is investigated, and the results indicate that the O H density everywhere in the detection zone is directly proport ional to the applied power. However, the input power has no significant influence on the propagation velocity and delivery distance, suggesting that it is unrealistic to increase the deliv ery distance of reactive species by increasing the power deliv ered to plasma.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717506","","Laser theory;Atmospheric measurements;Surface discharges;Pulse measurements;Programmable logic arrays;Fault location;Plasma measurements","afterglows;convection;electrodes;fluorescence;helium;hydrogen compounds;plasma applications;plasma chemistry;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma production;plasma sources","laser spectroscopic diagnosis;atmospheric discharge plasma;cold atmospheric pressure plasmas;desirable features;reactive chemical species;biomedical effects;CAP sources;SMD array configuration;discharge volume;plasma uniformity;OH as well as NO radicals;laser-induced fluorescence;radical density distributi;pulse duration;inter-pulse period;electrohydrodynamic force;OH radicals;surface plasma layer;dielectric surface;OH density;post-discharge;reactive species;plasma array technologies;atmospheric pressure pulsed-modulated surface microdischarge","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Literature suggests that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) can be degraded by either oxidative species or reductive species. The main objective of this work is to utilize an Ar carrier gas combined with a H2O/PFOA mixture (50 ppm) as the liquid phase to study the reaction pathway direction, i.e. oxidative or reductive, in a gas-liquid plasma discharge reactor. The gas phase was analyzed for by-products using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The liquid phase was analyzed using ion chromatography for F− and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) for final concentration of PFOA and shorter chain intermediate products. In this work, the role of OH and e− aq on the degradation pathway of PFOA in gas-liquid plasma reactors will be investigated. A variable nanosecond power supply is utilized to determine the effects of pulse width, frequency and input voltage on the efficiency of OH, H, e− aq generation, and in turn on PFOA degradation.

In the absence of collisions, kinetic physics dictates the behavior of these ExB configuration plasmas, and thereby particle drifts, microinstabilities, and finite gyromotion can affect mass, momentum, and energy transport. To understand these nuanced dynamics and transport properties, this work investigates ExB environment plasmas using conservative fourth-order finite-volume Vlasov-Poisson simulations in (x, y, vx, vy) phase space. The enhanced-accuracy solutions feature robust convergence properties, which offer a mathematical check on whether simulations produce the correct answer. The study of isolated kinetic physics is facilitated through the development of a new method for constructing customizable two-species kinetic equilibria with large density and electric field gradients.1 These advances are leveraged to study the linear and nonlinear dynamics of lower hybrid drift instabilities and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the presence of significant finite Larmor radius effects.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717961","U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract(grant numbers:DE-AC52-07NA27344); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717961","","Plasma properties;Performance evaluation;Power transmission lines;Mathematical models;Kinetic theory;Tokamaks;Nonlinear dynamical systems","drift instability;finite volume methods;Kelvin-Helmholtz instability;plasma collision processes;plasma density;plasma instability;plasma kinetic theory;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;Poisson equation;Tokamak devices;Vlasov equation","low-beta ExB plamas;high-order continuum kinetic simulations;low-density plasmas;electric fields;magnetic fields;orthogonal feature complex transport properties;low-beta devices;Hall thrusters;magnetically insulated transmission lines;ExB configuration plasmas;particle drifts;finite gyromotion;energy transport;nuanced dynamics;ExB environment plasmas;finite-volume Vlasov-Poisson simulations;enhanced-accuracy solutions;robust convergence properties;isolated kinetic physics;two-species kinetic equilibria;electric field gradients","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For successful weldment using this process the design of actuator is the most important factor due to high magnetic field on surface of work piece. In case of high quality welding factors such as impact velocity, impact angle standoff distance, flyer thickness and overlap length have to be chosen carefully. Still the surface of actuators plays vital role over all those above mentioned factors. EMPW has wide applications in nuclear industry, automotive industry, aerospace, electrical industries. However major issues such as formability and weldability still remain due to surface degradation. Surface degradation affects the magnetic field on surface of work piece. Due to ease in controlling the magnetic field enveloped inside tubes, the EMPW has been widely used for tube welding. In case of flat components control of magnetic field is difficult. Hence the application of EMPW gets restricted. But both tube and flat welding methods face same actuator surface degradation.

However, direct plasma treatment on water hasn't been extensively studied yet. In this study, the change in physical, chemical and biological parameters by the means of direct DBD plasma activation was examined. The significant reduction in the concentration of biological parameters such as total coliform and E. coli with increasing treatment time was found. Besides that, DBD plasma also lowered down the concentration of physical parameters such as pH, turbidity, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, and increases electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen. In addition, the significant drop in the concentration of chemical parameters such as chromium, manganese, sodium, phosphorus, and calcium was found along with the reduction in heavy metals concentration such as iron, cadmium, lead, and zinc. However, the concentration of nitrite, nitrate, and sulfur augmented gradually. Soaking seeds in plasma activated water (PAW) not only serves as an anti-bacterial but also enhanced the seed germination and plant growth. In case of radish, the action of PAW contributed to the early seed germination, improved content of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves, plants growth, insect control and soil remediation, which altogether contributed towards an increased food production as compared to normal water.

In this work, the circuit inductance was varied within a wide range from 1.55 $\Box\mathrm{H}$ to 93.2 $\Box\mathrm{H}$ by inserting inductive coils to study its effects on electrical and shock wave (SW) characteristics. Experimental results showed that SW peak pressure several-emaway from the wire is not sensitive to the increase of circuit inductance when properly choosing the diameter of load wire: the SW peak pressure obtained with varied diameter (with constant energy storage and wire length) only showed a decrease of 30% as the circuit inductance increased by 60 times from 1.55 $\Box\mathrm{H}$ (0.3 mm diameter, 19 MPa) to 93.2 $\Box\mathrm{H}$ (0.2 mm diameter, 13 MPa). Hydrodynamic calculations based on a coupled model were used to explain the experimental results. These results indicated that for a practical UEWE system, long cable can be used to transfer the pulse current so that the energy storage can be far away from the load while keeping an acceptable loss of the capability of generating strong SWs, which greatly improves the flexibility of system designing for example by enabling much larger energy storage for certain harsh working environments.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717579","","Underwater cables;Inductance;Shock waves;Scholarships;Wires;Hydrodynamics;Plasmas","coils;copper;discharges (electric);exploding wires;plasma shock waves","SW peak pressure;circuit inductance;load wire;wire length;shock wave characteristics;underwater copper wire explosion;underwater electrical wire explosion;inductive coils","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moment models can assume small deviations away from thermodynamic equilibrium, e.g. $5N$-moment multi-fluid plasma model, or can allow larger deviations, e.g. $13N$-moment multi-fluid plasma model, which allows finite skew and kurtosis of the velocity PDF. Selecting a plasma model determines the degree of physical fidelity and the corresponding required computational effort. To enable self-consistent multiscale modeling of plasmas, this research develops the mathematical and numerical techniques to enable robust hybrid formulations1. The finite element method (FEM) is well suited for these continuum plasma models, which contain multiple spatial and temporal scales as well as contributions from hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic terms. Furthermore, the high-order-accurate FEM provides unique benefits for problems that have strong anisotropies and complicated geometries and for stiff equation systems that are coupled through large source terms, e.g. Lorentz force, collisions, or atomic reactions. Magnetized plasma simulations of realistic devices using the kinetic or multi-fluid plasma models are examples that benefit from high-order accuracy. The governing equations are expressed in a balance law form and solved using discontinuous Galerkin and hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods. The algorithms to solve the various plasma models are implemented in the flexible WARPXM code, which facilitates high-performance computing in an extensible framework. The computational methods are applied to investigate species separation in inertial confinement fusion capsules, electromagnetic wave propagation through plasma photonic crystals, disruption mechanisms of the plasma opening switch, drift wave turbulence in the Z pinch, and deviations away from thermodynamic equilibrium in collisionless magnetic reconnection.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717941","AFOSR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717941","","Thermodynamics;Computational modeling;Switches;Probability density function;Mathematical models;Plasmas;Numerical models","finite element analysis;Galerkin method;magnetic reconnection;Maxwell equations;plasma drift waves;plasma kinetic theory;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation","high-order finite element method;high-fidelity plasma modeling;mathematical models;multifluid moment models;separate fluid;single-fluid MHD models;self-consistent multiscale modeling;continuum plasma models;high-order-accurate FEM;magnetized plasma simulations;plasma photonic crystals;plasma opening switch;moment multifluid plasma model","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These devices demonstrated drastic improvements in performance in the past several years. Recent efforts in the wavefunction engineering using an active region design based on a dual-upper-state concept led to a significant enhancement of the optical nonlinearity of the active region for efficient terahertz generation.1 Our terahertz quantum cascade laser sources packaged in butterfly modules exhibit the power of >0.3 mW, with octave spanning comb-like terahertz emission spectra. In this presentation, we discuss low frequency generation from terahertz quantum cascade laser sources based on intra-cavity nonlinear frequency mixing. In order to obtain higher nonlinear susceptibility in low frequency region, we design a long wavelength dual-upper-state active region in which transition dipole moments are increased.2 A fabricated device with distributed feedback grating demonstrates a THz peak output power of $40\ \mu \mathrm{W}$ at room temperature, with multi-mode THz emission at a frequency of 1.4 THz. Besides, a device produces THz output power of $> 250\ \mu \mathrm{W}$ at 110 K, which is higher output power, compared to low-frequency (1.2-1.6 THz) THz-QCLs at liquid helium temperature (10 K).

One configuration is of a linearly-polarized electric and magnetic fields. In a second configuration, a steady axial magnetic field is added to circularly-polarized oscillating fields. For an appropriate phase difference, charged particles, the cyclotron frequencies of which lie on the two opposite sides of the cyclotron resonance, are accelerated in opposite directions. Ion collisions with neutrals cause the ion acceleration to result in a drift velocity of the ions. Surprisingly, the collisions do not impede the mass separation.

In plasma ALE of dielectrics (e.g., SiO2, Si3N4) in fluorocarbon gas mixtures, etching proceeds through deposition of a thin polymer layer, and the process is not strictly self-terminating. As a result, ALE performance is a delicate balance between deposition of polymer during the first half of the cycle and etching (with polymer removal) during the second half. In the absence of complete removal of the overlying polymer in each cycle, ALE may be transient as the polymer thickness grows with each cycle. With small amounts of polymer left on the surface, roughening may be reinforced by there being a variation in polymer thickness.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717844","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Sciences(grant numbers:DE-SC000319,DE-SC0020232); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717844","","Silicon compounds;Fabrication;Atomic layer deposition;Etching;Surface roughness;Plasmas;Rough surfaces","elemental semiconductors;etching;gas mixtures;plasma materials processing;polymers;silicon;silicon compounds;sputter etching;surface roughness","atomic layer etching;fluorocarbon plasmas;transient etching;cyclic plasma process;self-terminating;plasma ALE;fluorocarbon gas mixtures;polymer layer;ALE performance;polymer removal;overlying polymer;polymer thickness","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we present that phase transition has been found by tuning air gap between prism and doped silicon metasurface at terahertz frequencies, which has enabled many applications in a diversified field3. An exact formula was derived which predicts the critical air gap when gradient phase change transits from positive to negative. Based on this, a novel reflection sensing platform for enhanced fingerprint detection of lactose in an ATR configuration of prism is proposed4. We can verify the transition from the AIT to TIR by shifting the lactose film from area of spoof SPP enhanced field to the bottom of the prism. The reflectance change $\Delta \mathrm{R}$ is observed from 41.9 % to 72.4 % based on AIT compared to TIR from 25.3 % to 25.8 %, correspondingly that the sensitivity is 5 times higher than TIR. Finally, by using such ATR, occlusion and compression of the skin affect the THz response upon contacting the imaging window. In order to determine how experimental influence factors in vivo THz measurements of human skin affects the THz properties, variables are in need of investigations5.

Consequently, direct frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) essentially replaces the need for simultaneous measurements using thousands of precise narrow lasers and hence has the potential to become the ultimate tool for precision broadband spectroscopy. We report on the use of mid-infrared DFCS as a novel plasma diagnostic applied to spectroscopic investigations of plasma nitrocarburizing processes used for hardening of steel components.

We propose to boost strong-field photoemission by coating the nanopyramid field emitter with an atomic-thick dielectric coating layer. This layer greatly increases the optical field enhancement near the emitter tip, in the meanwhile, creates a reduced double tunneling profile with increased electron emission probability. We performed numerical optical simulations, and use a quantum photoemission model to predict the performance of coated field emitter. We find that with 1 nm thick layer (refractive index of 1.5) coated at the gold nanotip, the electron emission current density can be enhanced by at least two orders of magnitude over a wide range of laser intensity, thanks to the increased local optical field enhancement factor from 35 to 200 (or intensity enhancement factor of 40000). The emission current can further increase with coating of even higher refractive index. The coated field emitter may be selectively excited with different plasmonic resonant modes by choosing the wavelength of laser source, such that the electron emission patterns and the emission current are tunable. This theoretical study paves the way of developing a new category of high performance field emitters operating at tunable optical frequencies.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717621","","Integrated optics;Stimulated emission;Atom optics;Refractive index;Predictive models;Optical variables control;Electron optics","current density;dielectric thin films;electron field emission;gold;laser beam effects;nanophotonics;nanostructured materials;optical films;photoelectron spectra;photoemission;plasmonics;refractive index","coated field emitter;electron emission current density;plasmonic resonant modes;electron emission patterns;tunable optical frequencies;resonant optical field emission;photoelectron emission;optical electric field;quantum efficiency;strong-field photoemission;nanopyramid field emitter;atomic-thick dielectric coating layer;local optical field enhancement factor;reduced double tunneling;quantum photoemission model;refractive index;gold nanotip;laser source;Au","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work we extend the adjoint approach to particle-field dynamic follow early reported in1 to provide fast calculations of multi-dimensional derivatives needed for more advanced gradient based optimization algorithms. Using this property of the system we have derived a relationship between the perturbed solution and an adjoint solution to the linearized equations. We show that proper selection of the adjoint solution allows obtaining compact symplectic equations.

The generation of the OAM mode based on the spoof surface plasmon (SSP) is presented in this paper. The SSP on the helical grating is introduced and the dispersion characteristic is analyzed. The phase of SSP in this system changes along the angular direction and carries OAM mode, which is different from the SSP generated from the cylindrical grating. When the free electron passes over the helical grating, the SSP can be excited effectively. However, as the wavenumber of the SSP is far larger than the wavenumber in the free space, the SSP is confined in the surface of the helical grating. By loading an asynchronous ring array, the SSP wave can be converted into the OAM mode. The operating frequency and the radiation can be tailored by the energy of the free electron. Moreover, the rotation of the OAM mode can be changed by the direction of the helical grating. The method introduced in this paper may provide an efficient way to generate the OAM and boost the applications of the OAM in the communication system.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717918","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61861130367); NSAF(grant numbers:U1830201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717918","","Wireless communication;Space vehicles;Surface waves;Loading;Terahertz radiation;Orbits;Plasmas","angular momentum;diffraction gratings;light interference;surface plasmons;terahertz waves","OAM mode;free electron;helical grating;SSP wave;spoof surface plasmon;angular direction;orbital angular momentum terahertz radiation;communication system;cylindrical grating","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In EBP system, electrons emitted by the incandescent cathode are focused by the electrostatic lens and accelerated by the electric field between the cathode and the crucible filled with evaporated material. At an initial instant, the evaporated material is melted due to electron bombardment effect. On achieving a certain vapor density (specific for each material) a non-independent discharge in material's vapor is developed within the anode-cathode gap (-,6-10 mm). The directly heated cathode changes it's purely thermo emission mode of operation into a combined - i.e. thermo- plus ion-electronic emission - mode. In our experiment, the evaporated material was pyrolitic graphite. Substrate holder temperature during deposition was 500°C (samples Q1, Q2) and 350°C (samples Q3, Q4,). Film thickness were 20 nm (samples Q1, Q3) and 25 nm (samples Q2, Q4). The elements concentrations in the films were determined by RBS and ERD analytical method. Raman spectroscopy was used for chemical structural features determination of carbon films. Elements concentration results were practically the same for the all samples: carbon - 93 at.%, nitrogen - 2 at.%, hydrogen - 2 at.%, oxygen - 3 at.%. Raman spectrum of carbon film, which is typical for all samples, was deconvoluted. We used five peaks fitting for the range 1000–1800 cm−1 and four peaks fitting for the range 2500–3300 cm−1, Nanostructured carbon film contained several carbon phases. The photo-induced (pulsed laser −266 nm) electron emission properties of carbon very thin films were determined by the measurement of cathode bunch charge and calculate quantum efficiency (QE) of the prepared back-side illuminated transmission photocathode. Best result of QE showed photocathode Q4 and was $\text{QE}(\%)\mathrm{x}10^{-2}=1.5$ at extraction field 4 kV/mm.

The control board features a microcontroller to provide added flexibility and safety. A PIC16 microcontroller and two fiber-optic cables are critical to the design. Optically isolated serial communication between the device and a remote PC is used to control every aspect of the output pulses. This allows for more specific configuration of the pulser and provides remote adjustment of the pulse generator. The design uses the microcontroller's digital I/O pins and SPI/UART peripherals to send and receive operating data over fiber-optic, control the output pulse repetition rate, interface with a digital potentiometer to change the signal amplitude, and activate components that send optically isolated signals to disable/enable the high voltage power supply. In the case of microcontroller failure, the design includes a backup circuit that reconfigures the fiber-optic receiver to trigger an output pulse instead of interpreting UART communication signals. This permits the operator to still trigger the Marx generator remotely in a “single-shot” mode. The successful operation of this device involves configuring the PIC16 to send a 4 kV pulse at repetition rates up to 1 kHz. The flexibility provided by the microcontroller allows customization of several aspects of the output pulse, leaving the design useful in almost any application requiring high voltage pulses.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717487","","Pulse generation;Optical fibers;Integrated optics;Microcontrollers;Optical fiber cables;Optical fiber communication;Optical receivers","microcontrollers;optical cables;optical receivers;potentiometers;pulse generators;pulsed power supplies;trigger circuits","microcontroller failure;fiber-optic receiver;UART communication signals;high voltage pulses;microcontroller control;solid state high-voltage pulse generator;spark-gap triggered Marx generator;control board features;PIC16 microcontroller;fiber-optic cables;remote PC;output pulse repetition rate;optically isolated signals;high voltage power supply;optical isolated serial communication;single-shot mode;digital I-O pins;SPI-UART peripherals;digital potentiometer;backup circuit;voltage 4.0 kV;frequency 1.0 kHz","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the practical use, however, limitation on the THz detection time should be solved. For many THz-based plasma diagnosis studies, THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) method based on electro-optic(EO) effect has been used. Although THz-TDS is a well-established conventional method, it usually requires several minutes or more to take a THz signal. This implies that users would find it difficult to diagnose short-lived plasmas with THz-TDS. In order to circumvent this issue then, a different THz detection method should be considered. In this presentation, we present the first experimental demonstration of THz-based plasma diagnosis using spectral encoding THz detection method.

Of all the CAP sources under investigation, the SMD array configuration offers a large area discharge wit h a considerable discharge volume enhances the plasma unifo rmity and provides an alternative to atmospheric pressure pla sma array technologies. This work presents the transport beh avior investigation of OH as well as NO radicals in an atmos pheric pressure pulsed-modulated surface micro-discharge in helium. Laser-induced fluorescence is employed to measure t he time development of OH and NO radical density distributi on during the pulse duration and the inter-pulse period. It is s hown that convection caused by ion wind due to electro hydr odynamic force enhances and dominates the transport of OH radicals from the surface plasma layer to the afterglow region with a distance up to 8 mm away from the dielectric surface. Interestingly, after the plasma switches off, OH density decre ases quickly near the electrode but the downstream distributi on region keeps constant, showing that the impact of convecti on is still present during the post-discharge. Additionally, the propagation velocity of OH declines monotonously with time. The maximum value is estimated as 1.86 m/s during the first 1 ms when the plasma is on. The influence of power delivere d to plasma is investigated, and the results indicate that the O H density everywhere in the detection zone is directly proport ional to the applied power. However, the input power has no significant influence on the propagation velocity and delivery distance, suggesting that it is unrealistic to increase the deliv ery distance of reactive species by increasing the power deliv ered to plasma.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717418","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51837008,11861131010,11705021); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT19LK07,DUT18TD02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717418","","Laser theory;Atmospheric measurements;Surface discharges;Pulse measurements;Programmable logic arrays;Fault location;Plasma measurements","afterglows;electrodes;fluorescence;plasma applications;plasma chemistry;plasma diagnostics;plasma sources","laser spectroscopic diagnosis;atmospheric discharge plasma;cold atmospheri c pressure plasmas;CAPS;reactive chemical species;biomedical effects;CAP sources;SMD array configuration;atmospheric pressure;plasma array technologies;OH as well as NO radicals;atmospheric pressure pulsed-modulated surface microdischarge;laser-induced fluorescence;radical density distribution;pulse duration;inter-pulse period;electrohydrodynamic force;OH radicals;surface plasma layer;dielectric surface;OH density decre ases;reactive species","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The solar radio bursts (SRB) from our Sun are relatively well understood. A commonly-favored explanation of the SRB is that the electromagnetic radio waves are emitted from the Langmuir waves, which are driven by energetic electron beams via bump-on-tail instability. Though this scenario has been widely verified, the conversion efficiency of the Langmuir-radio waves remains still controversial. Another interesting radio emission is the fast-radio-burst (FRB), which is believed to be originating with extremely high fluence from a point-like (i.e. in the astrophysical scale) source located outside the Milky way. However, the exact mechanism of FRB is obscure. In this talk, I present a theory and simulations of a recently-conceived, novel model for the coherent radio emission from plasmas. Our model is based on the concept of the plasma dipole oscillation (PDO), which is a stand-alone, localized plasma oscillation embedded in a plasma. It can be potentially a source of a strong cosmic radio bursts at fundamental and high harmonics of the plasma oscillation with high efficiency and diversely different polarization properties. We discovered a new solution of the fluid plasma equations, which theoretically proves that the PDO can really exist. The generation of the PDO and radio-bursts in laboratory-scale plasmas using colliding laser pulses has been demonstrated by 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations1, 2. Study of generating the similar PDO by colliding electron beams is under progress, to make the system reproduce the emission from space plasmas in the laboratory scale. Plans for experiments of the PDO emission is briefed.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717693","","Plasma properties;Laser theory;Three-dimensional displays;Fluids;Electron beams;Harmonic analysis;Mathematical models","astrophysical plasma;electron beams;numerical analysis;plasma density;plasma instability;plasma Langmuir waves;plasma oscillations;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;radiosources (astronomical);solar radiofrequency radiation","lab-scale plasmas;incoherent cosmic radio bursts;solar system;deep space;solar radio bursts;SRB;electromagnetic radio waves;Langmuir waves;energetic electron;bump-on-tail instability;conversion efficiency;Langmuir-radio waves;interesting radio emission;fast-radio-burst;FRB;astrophysical scale;coherent radio emission;plasma dipole oscillation;localized plasma oscillation;strong cosmic radio bursts;fundamental harmonics;high harmonics;fluid plasma equations;laboratory-scale plasmas;electron beams;space plasmas;laboratory scale;PDO emission","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The source of coherent VLF waves was the Navy NML Transmitter at 25.2 kHz located in La Moore, South Dakota. A region of the topside ionosphere at 480 km altitude was converted into an amplifying medium with a 60 second firing of the Cygnus BT-4 engine. The rocket exhaust was injected as a neutral cloud moving perpendicular to field lines that connected the NML transmitter to the VLF Radio Receiver Instrument (RRI) on e-POP/SWARM-E at 1080 km altitude. Charge exchange between the ambient O+ ions and the hypersonic water molecules in the exhaust produced an active plasma media with H2O+ ions in a ring-beam velocity distribution. The 25.2 kHz VLF signal from NML was amplified by 30 dB for a period 87 seconds as observed with the electric fields measurements by the RRI. A secondary source of coherent ELF waves was amplified by 50 dB relative to a 300 Hz signal before the engine burn. The 300 Hz ELF waves are of unknown origin but they were related to harmonics of 100 Hz recorded by the RRI more the 600 seconds before the Cygnus burn. Extremely strong coherent emissions and quasi-periodic bursts were observed in the 300 to 310 Hz frequency range for 200 seconds after the release. The excitation of a ELF whistler cavity may have lasted longer but the orbit of the SWARM-E/e-POP moved the RRI sensor away from the wave emission region. Propagation analysis suggests that the 25.2 kHz VLF waves are less likely to be trapped in plasmaspheric ducts than the 300 Hz ELF band. The 50 dB amplification of the ELF modes may be the result of multi-hop whistler modes echoing between geomagnetic-conjugate hemispheres, gaining energy by cyclotron resonance with the radiation belt electrons.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717553","","Space vehicles;Rockets;Ground penetrating radar;Rail to rail inputs;Radio transmitters;Geophysical measurement techniques;Ions","cyclotron resonance;ionospheric electromagnetic wave propagation;magnetospheric electromagnetic wave propagation;radiation belts;radio receivers;rocket engines;whistlers","satellite rocket engine;rocket exhaust plume;whistler mode waves;VLF waves;Navy NML Transmitter;South Dakota;topside ionosphere;Cygnus BT-4 engine;hypersonic water molecules;ring-beam velocity distribution;ELF waves;ELF whistler cavity;RRI sensor;ELF modes;multihop whistler modes;neutral gas injection;VLF radio receiver instrument;ELF-VLF signals;rocket exhaust driven amplification;REDA;AD 2020 05 26;La Moore;e-POP-SWARM-E;plasmaspheric ducts;geomagnetic-conjugate hemispheres;cyclotron resonance;frequency 25.2 kHz;time 60.0 s;noise figure 30.0 dB;time 87.0 s;noise figure 50.0 dB;frequency 100.0 Hz;time 600.0 s;time 200.0 s;frequency 300.0 Hz to 310.0 Hz","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, we have proposed a new type of on-chip electron source based on electroformed silicon oxide between graphene films on silicon oxide1, which is named electron- emitting nanodiode (EEND). Electron emission from our devices is thought to be generated from horizontal tunneling diodes formed in electroformed silicon oxide. The EEND can be turned on by a voltage of ~7 V in ~100 ns and show an emission current of up to several microamperes, corresponding to an emission density of ~106 A/cm2 and emission efficiency as high as 16.6%. Since using semicondutor fabrication technolgy makes its fabrication very easy, an array of 100 EENDs is fabricated in an effective area of 82 μm ×18 μm and its emission current reaches 73.4 μA, which exhibits a global emission density of 5 A/cm2 and stable emission with negligible current degradation over tens of hours under a vacuum of ~5 × 10-6 Pa. Recent experiments show emission current increases linearly with the numbers of EENDs in an array, and emission current has reached to 1 mA. Combined advantages of high emission current and density, high emission efficiency, low working voltage, and easy fabrication make our on-chip electron sources promising in realizing miniature and on-chip electronic devices and systems based on free electron beams.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717449","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0205003); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11874068,11890671,61621061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717449","","Fabrication;Films;Graphene;Voltage;Vacuum technology;Tunneling;Silicon","electroforming;electron beams;electron emission;electron sources;graphene;silicon compounds;thin films;tunnel diodes","on-chip electron source;electroforming;electron- emitting nanodiode;emission current;graphene films;tunneling diodes;C;SiO2","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many ways to extend the frequency tuning range of such a device. By loading a small cavity at the upstream end of the open cavity, the interaction efficiency in the backward-wave region could be significantly enhanced by such pre-bunching technique. A tapered cavity structure could suppress high-Q competing modes and facilitate smooth frequency tuning on a single mode. Furthermore, by employing a cluster of whispering gallery mode operation, the frequency-tuning gyrotron was predicted to switch from one mode to a close-by higher order mode and during this mode switch process, the gyrotron could generate a chirped pulse within the range of several tens of GHz in the THz band.

In this study, we focus on Ar-02 plasma and the dominant reactive species fluxes: singlet oxygen, O, O3 and ions produced by a modulated radiofrequency (RF)-driven plasma jet. We investigate the impact of different plasma parameters on the different species fluxes by absolute molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). The following plasma operating parameters have been investigated: the plasma dissipated power, feed gas composition, treatment distance, modulation frequency and duty cycle as well as the feed gas flow rate. This extensive study shows that for a fixed feed gas composition and plasma dissipated power, the ratio of short-lived (0, ions) and long-lived (O3 and singlet oxygen) species fluxes can be changed by orders of magnitude by changing the treatment distance and the plasma modulation frequency. Furthermore, changing the gas flow rate is found to be potentially an effective approach to tune the ratio of the O and ion fluxes. The results presented in this contribution can be a valuable tool to control the reactive species fluxes to substrates by tuning plasma operating parameters, for plasma-surface interactions and in particular of plasma catalysis.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717929","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CBET 1703439); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717929","","Radio frequency;Frequency modulation;Plasma jets;Fluid flow;Ions;Plasmas;Catalysis","argon;catalysis;mass spectroscopic chemical analysis;nitrogen compounds;organic compounds;oxygen;plasma chemistry;plasma flow;plasma jets;plasma materials processing;plasma sources;plasma transport processes;plasma-wall interactions","plasma dissipated power;plasma modulation frequency;plasma-surface interactions;plasma catalysis;control reactive species fluxes;radiofrequency-driven plasma jet;molecular beam mass spectrometry;MBMS;feed gas composition;singlet oxygen;feed gas flow rate;O;O3;O2;Ar","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The device was simulated by using the 3-D PIC code VSim at its typical operating conditions (18kV, 5A, 1900G, 896-929MHz). The simulated geometry of the device is a one-to-one reconstruction of the physical device based on drawings provided by L3 Electron Devices Inc. The startup behavior was examined with 1) no priming of any kind, 2) RF Priming, and 3) cathode modulation. With no priming or modulation of any kind, the simulated device failed to oscillate in a simulation time of 300 ns; this result was expected since the actual device startup may take milliseconds. For the RF priming study, a $\pi$-mode RF field at the magnetron's operating power (75kW) was defined in the magnetron's interaction space; this driving field was then shut off after 50 ns. Upon removal of the RF driving field, the RF field strength in the interaction space begins to decay; however, after another 100 ns (150 ns from the beginning of the simulation), the RF field strength begins to regrow, and the device starts to oscillate. With cathode modulation, electrons are injected in-phase to form electron spokes; the simulated device was able to reach full oscillation within 130ns of startup by continuous modulated electron injection. Analysis of the cavity voltage, after full oscillation was reached, indicates an oscillation frequency of 898.07-914.49 MHz.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717881","","Radio frequency;Phased arrays;Geometry;Frequency modulation;Phase control;Logic gates;Plasmas","cathodes;electron field emission;electronic engineering computing;magnetrons;modulation;vacuum microelectronics","industrial magnetron;cathode modulation;phase control;controlled electron injection;gated field emission arrays;3D PIC code VSim;simulated geometry;physical device;startup behavior;priming modulation;RF priming study;RF driving field;RF field strength;electron spokes;continuous modulated electron injection;CWM industrial strapped magnetron;GFEA;L3 Electron Devices Inc.;power 75.0 kW;time 50.0 ns;time 100.0 ns;time 150.0 ns;time 130.0 ns;wavelength 5.0 A;frequency 896.0 MHz to 929.0 MHz;voltage 18.0 kV;time 300.0 ns","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, demands for flexible plasma sources have been rapidly increasing as target objects of plasma applications have become diverse and also become high-dimensional. Here, we propose a new approach of a pouch type flexible dielectric barrier discharge (FXDBD) plasma source. This volume restriction enables to concentrate chemical species that are crucial in a particular application such as sterilization of the target surface or removal of biofilms. One key finding is that physical and chemical changes in the flexible electrode affect the plasma characteristics. In this presentation, the physiochemical properties of the FXDBD plasma and its practical challenges for plasma applications will be discussed. As a viability study for delaying spoilage of food ingredients using the plasma pouch, an experiment was performed using blueberries. Four groups of blueberries were placed inside the pouch and treated for 0, 1, 3, and 5 minutes, respectively, which were then stored at room temperature without additional gas or chemical injection. According to visual inspection, blueberries did not show any significant physical damage caused by the in-package plasma treatment, compared to the control sample. At 72 hours after the treatment, white fungi grew on about 56% blueberries in the control group, while only 10% show fungi growth in the 5 minutes treated group. At the same time, it was observed that the growth of the fungi was remarkably reduced in the group with plasma treatment. We expect that the well-characterized and well-established FXDBD may extend the plasma application area and can be selectively utilized for specific purposes from disposable to semi-permanent use.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717747","","Fungi;Electrodes;Plasma applications;Visualization;Surface discharges;Inspection;Plasmas","agricultural products;biotechnology;films;food preservation;food processing industry;food products;microorganisms;plasma materials processing;plasma sources;sterilisation (microbiological)","blueberries;in-package plasma treatment;shelf life extension;plasma pouch;atmospheric pressure plasmas;flexible plasma sources;chemical species;physical changes;chemical changes;flexible electrode;plasma characteristics;FXDBD plasma;flexible dielectric barrier discharge plasma source;food ingredients;sterilization;biofilms;time 1.0 min;time 3.0 min;time 5.0 min;time 72.0 hour","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its effects range from signal degradation to the damage and destruction of microwave components. Thus, multipactor physics has been studied through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiment. Previously, we developed a direct electron observation system using an Electron Multiplier Tube (EMT) and succeeded to directly detect multipactoring electrons in the center of the broadwall of rectangular waveguides 1, 2. Here, we provide a method for evaluating the electric charge density and secondary emission yield (SEY) in waveguides. The experimentally obtained EMT signal is analyzed with the extensive usage of the numerical simulation software Spark3D. The software was utilized to analyze multipactor onset in waveguide structures, where the electric field distribution without multipactor was carefully simulated, employing high-frequency solvers. The EMT signal and the charge density were simulated for the same conditions as the experiment. As a result, a calibration line indicating the proportional relation between the EMT voltage and the charge density, which is independent of some conditions, i.e., input power and gap size, was obtained. Further, after adjusting the SEY curve imported to Spark3D, the rising shape of the experimental EMT signal pulses fit with the simulated one, and the experimental threshold power for the EMT signal generation was consistent with the simulated multipactor threshold power. Since the simulation matches the experiment in threshold power and signal shape, one expects that the charge density and SEY curve deduced from the simulation are accurate.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717525","AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717525","","Microwave integrated circuits;Satellites;Shape;Rectangular waveguides;Microwave devices;Numerical simulation;Microwave theory and techniques","calibration;electron multipliers;microwave switches;numerical analysis;rectangular waveguides;secondary emission","rectangular waveguides;electric charge density;secondary emission yield;multipactor onset;waveguide structures;electric field distribution;high-frequency solvers;EMT voltage;SEY curve;experimental EMT signal pulses;experimental threshold power;EMT signal generation;simulated multipactor threshold power;signal shape;experimental multipactor observation signals;resonant nonlinear electron multiplication effect;high power microwave devices;particle accelerators;satellite subsystems;signal degradation;microwave components;multipactor physics;theoretical analysis;direct electron observation system;Electron Multiplier Tube;numerical simulation software Spark3D","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Relevant dual-stage PF properties such as axial and radial velocities, pinches dimensions and durations, temperatures, densities as well as the emitting radiations of the two focus events are presented and discussed. The results show that the dual-stage PF shares the general characteristics of the conventional PF where the axial and radial speeds of the dual PF are in the same ranges of the conventional PF. The drive factors (SF) of the focus events are still a direct measure of the speed of the formed CSs. The correlation between the speeds and the temperatures are clear. The soft x-ray outputs increase as the pinch volume increases. The scaling relationships of the conventional PF are preserved in the dual PF where the pinch radius ratio, pinch length ratio, and pinch duration per anode radius are nearly constant for the two focus events.

However, accurate complex permittivity measurement in the frequency band beyond 100GHz is very difficult, therefore, references of permittivity data of materials are still lacking.1 One of the measurement methods in low-frequency uses a fundamental TE10 mode in the rectangular waveguide. However, it cannot be used in high frequency region because the dimension of experimental setup becomes diminishing, therefore, the air gap effect which causes disruption of resonance peaks grows bigger. In comparison to the TE10 mode, the TE01 mode has proven to provide very accurate measurement due to its low fields at surface of waveguide.2 Furthermore, the measurement using the TE01. mode is also easier from sample size limitation. In this paper, we present the extended research on the permittivity measurement by using the TE01 mode in the frequency beyond 300GHz from our previous work in W-band.

Problems with these dividers are energy handling capability of resistors and capacitors. To avoid this problem, liquid resistors are used which can handle more energy. But the liquid resistors undergo ageing and are sensitive to frequency, temperature changes in the liquid. A $300 \ \Omega$ electrolyte resistor was designed for high voltage arm and tested with different frequency sources are 50Hz AC, 7MHz Co-axial cable-based Pulse Forming Line (PFL) and LCR meter having frequency range 0 to 100kHz to know characteristics of liquid resistor with respect to frequency variations. Testing results and conclusions are given in paper. Lower arm of the divider was made with five $5\Omega$ resistors connected in parallel to meet power handling capability of resistor placed in two-port network box. Lower arm of the divider must behave like an integrator and structural impedance matches to high voltage arm. But in the case of practical considerations to meat this is not possible. Due to this mismatched impedance large amount of reflections takes place at the output of the divider. To avoid this reflection perfect termination resistor is necessary. Simulations were done in the Pspice software with and without terminating resistor and observed that terminating resistor plays key role to act low voltage arm as an integrator. A 600kV(theoretically), 20ns risetime bi-polar Marx generator voltage pulse has been measured using developed divider with and without terminating resistor and results are compared with the simulation results.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717750","","Resistors;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Liquids;Temperature;High-voltage techniques;Reflection","electrical resistivity;impedance matching;pulse generators;pulsed power supplies;resistors;SPICE;voltage dividers;voltage measurement","high voltage arm;reflection perfect termination resistor;terminating resistor;low voltage arm;voltage divider;resistive dividers;capacitive dividers;capacitors;liquid resistor;different frequency sources;frequency variations;lower arm;bipolar Marx generator voltage pulse;electrolyte resistor;structural impedance matches;voltage 600.0 kV;time 20.0 ns;frequency 0.0 kHz to 100.0 kHz","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Plasma liquefaction is one of the most promising ways for energy conversion and utilization through highly-reactive chemistry which helps convert biomass into valuable energy carriers1, 2. However, biomass dramatically ranges in the feedstock content of hemicelluloses, cellulose, lignin, and ash. Here, we performed the liquefaction of three typical lignocellulosic materials (sawdust, corncob and rice straw) with different feedstock contents using the plasma-enabled liquefaction (PEL) process. The sulfuric acid and the mixture of the polyethylene glycol 200 and glycerol were used as the catalyst and the liquefacient, respectively. The influence of the catalyst content and the reaction time on the degradation of each biomass was investigated to understand the effect of feedstock content on the liquefaction yield. It is shown that corncob were completely liquefied into crude bio-oil under the following optimal conditions- 5 g corncob, 1.5% catalyst volume percentage, 7/1 liquefacient/corncob mass ratio, 3 min reaction time, and 1.38 molar ratio of PEG 200 and glycerol. Based on the chemical element analysis of biomass samples and the associated liquefied samples coupled with a comprehensive analysis of their FTIR and GC/MS results, the chemical contents of the lignecellulosic biomass especially the amount of lignin and ash significantly influenced the liquefaction yield, the quality of liquid products and the distributions of the liquefied chemicals. The maximum energy yield (liquid fuels) were achieved in the plasma-enabled liquefaction of sawdust having the highest content of lignin. The PEL process in this work is a promising approach for biomass liquefaction with higher liquefaction rate and energy efficiency.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717951","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807087,51907087); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717951","","Liquids;Polyethylene;Catalysts;Ash;Transforms;Energy conversion;Energy efficiency","bioenergy conversion;biofuel;catalysts;liquefaction;pyrolysis;renewable materials;spectrochemical analysis","plasma-enabled fast liquefaction;lignocellulosic biomass;biomass feedstocks;biomass liquefaction;renewable biomass;high-grade fuels;plasma liquefaction;energy conversion;highly-reactive chemistry;valuable energy carriers;feedstock content;lignin;typical lignocellulosic materials;different feedstock contents;plasma-enabled liquefaction process;catalyst content;liquefaction yield;1.5% catalyst volume percentage;3 min reaction time;chemical element analysis;biomass samples;chemical contents;lignecellulosic biomass;liquefied chemicals;maximum energy yield;highest content;higher liquefaction rate;mass 5.0 g;time 3.0 min","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most complex and significant ones in THz band require a miniaturized cylindrical three-dimensional structure, vacuum-tight enclosure and a typical requirement for magnetic field to confine or control the electron beam. The miniaturized structure reduces the power handling capabilities of the source and also limits the cylindrical beam propagation inside it due to space charge effect [2]. The sheet-electron beam has advantages over cylindrical-electron beam in terms of reduced space charge field [3]. However, in-depth research is required to understand the challenges involved in the propagation of the sheet-electron-beam in such miniaturized structure. The issue can be addressed by the presence of plasma inside such structure during the propagation of the sheet-electron beam. Experimental analysis has been carried out for beam current analysis in the drift space for different applied gap voltages between 10 kV-20 kV in self-breakdown mode.

The pulsed arc works as an essential energy channel in the arc chamber of the switch, and transfers the pulsed current that is up to 300kA. However, the high-temperature arc will destroy the electrodes, leaving the erosive electrode surface. The transient temperature modeling of pulsed arc has been built in magneto-hydrodynamics method. Based on the characteristics of the graphite material and plasma-solid interface heat conduction, the anode temperature of graphite has been calculated, which explains the mechanism of the graphite sublimation. With the purpose of extending the lifetime and improving the reliability, the atmosphere-adjusting method is selected as an excellent to solve the problem. Compared with traditional gas in the spark switch, we find that the premixed gas with 80% Argon and 20% Oxygen could decrease the heating rate, and the quality of sublimation will be lower.

The goal is to develop a controllable surface that is free from confounding issues with larger plasma-liquid interface experiments (i.e. convective stirring in a petri dish). This work is for the design and characterization of an open channel microfluidics test bed to reach this goal. The result is a test bed with a series of 120 microchannels set on a $25\times 50$ mm silica slide. Microfluidic channels are driven by capillary flow and flow and flow performance is highly dependent on channel geometry. Several geometries were investigated, and it was found that a rectangular cross section balances good performance with ease of manufacturing. The channels are $100\ \mu \mathrm{m}$ wide and $100\ \mu \mathrm{m}$ deep with a spacing of $100\ \mu \mathrm{m}$. There are reservoirs on either end of the channels, one for fluid input and another for spatially resolved fluid extraction from the channels.

However, various aspects of wireless device design have an effect on the potential for ignition which include the antenna/receiver's geometry, power, and operational frequency. For a safe integration of wireless devices in flammable leakage zones, a better understanding of radio frequency (RF) fields on ignition hazard is required. There are three ignition scenarios connected with the usage of wireless sensors. First, a direct ignition can occur when an antenna acts as an electrode and generates electrical discharges. Fortunately, this scenario is highly improbable due to the low power of wireless sensors. A second possible scenario is a coupling of RF fields with a large metallic structure. This metallic structure (e.g., a chassis or a net of electrical wires), may act as an antenna by intercepting energy from a surrounding electromagnetic field (wireless sensors) and start resonating at its frequency. The third possible ignition scenario is a coupling of RF signals with parasitic electrical discharges (static electricity, lightning). This effect may lead to an increase of the discharge volume and the energy deposition, which can be the reason for an undesirable ignition1. This study focuses on this scenario. The effect of RF signals at 2.45 GHz on electrical discharges produced by a high-voltage pulse, ranging from 500 ns to $200\ \mu \mathrm{s}$, in a pin-to-pin configuration in air at ambient conditions is investigated. An analysis of the effect of the RF power on the energy deposited by the discharge and the breakdown voltage is performed. The results show that for very short pulses (500 ns), RF signals with a power as large as 50 W do not affect the discharges, while for longer pulses, RF signals start to affect both, the breakdown voltage and the energy deposition.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717921","","Wireless communication;Radio frequency;Couplings;Wireless sensor networks;RF signals;Wires;Ignition","electric breakdown;electric field measurement;electromagnetic fields;ignition","RF signals;high-voltage pulse;RF power;breakdown voltage;short pulses;energy deposition;RF fields;electrical breakdowns;wireless device design;operational frequency;flammable leakage zones;radio frequency fields;ignition hazard;wireless sensors;direct ignition;metallic structure;electrical wires;parasitic electrical discharges;static electricity;discharge volume;power 50.0 W;time 500.0 ns to 200.0 mus;frequency 2.45 GHz","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They also seem to emanate from the reconnection region and migrate to the periphery of the ropes at the start of the experiment.

In such applications, high-speed operation of electronic switches is challenging especially when high-amplitude output signals are required4. For instance, although field-effect and bipolar junction devices present good controllability and robust performance, their relatively large output capacitance with respect to their ON-state current significantly limits their switching speeds5. Here we demonstrate a novel on-chip all-electronic device concept based on nano-scale plasma (nanoplasma) that enables picosecond switching of electric signals with a wide range of power levels6. The very high electric field in the small spatial scale of the nanoplasma leads to an ultra-fast electron transfer, resulting in extremely short time responses. Ultra-fast switching speed, higher than 10 V/ps was achieved, which is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of field-effect transistors and more than ten times faster than the fastest electronic switch nowadays. Extremely short rise-times were measured down to 5-ps which was limited by the employed measurement set-up. A monolithically integrated circuit capable of generating 45-V impulses with 11-ps pulse-width was demonstrated. By integrating these devices with dipole antennas, high-power THz signals with $Pf^{2}$ = 600 mW.THz2 were emitted, which is significantly larger than in state-of-the-art solid-state electronics.

Improvements to the trapping rate have been enabled2 by enhanced stabilization and manipulation of the plasmas. ECR-based magnetometry3 has reached the 1ppm level, increasing the accuracy of measurements of the antiatoms. The improved trapping allows, in turn, for faster measurements of antihydrogen properties (avoiding systematic uncertainties from slow changes in magnetic fields). Entire 1 S-2S spectra can be measured in a day rather than in weeks. Achieving over 1000 antiatoms trapped simultaneously enabled high precision hyperfine measurements.

For almost a century since Langmuir's work [1], models of sheaths with electron emission assumed that the surface is below the plasma potential for all emission intensities. In recent works, we showed that under sufficient emission, surfaces rise above the plasma potential and form an inverse sheath [2]–[4] such that plasma ions are confined. In the inverse regime, major changes to the plasma occur which are not seen in conventional sheath regimes. In this presentation, we demonstrate properties of plasmas bounded by inverse sheaths using our newly developed continuum simulation codes in various 1D and 2D geometric configurations. Important applications across plasma science will be discussed. For example, numerous devices that rely on thermionic cathodes such as filament discharges, Hall thrusters, and thermionic converters, could be designed to operate in the inverse mode to minimize cathode sputtering and power consumption, thereby extending device lifetime [2]. We predict that thermionic divertor plates with inverse sheaths can cause extreme cooling of the nearby plasma which might be used to mitigate plasma-wall interaction problems (sputtering, melting, arcing) in tokamaks [3], [4]. Other recent results regarding inverse sheaths by us and other researchers will be reviewed with applications to emissive probes, negative ion sources, and capacitively-coupled discharges.

However, a key obstacle for the low insertion loss of terahertz integrated circuits is the development of practical packaging technology that allows TMICs to interface with rectangular waveguides. Due to increasingly higher reactance and losses with increasing frequencies, direct wire bond interconnects become impractical. As proposed by the author, an effective method is to de-embed the parasitic parameters introduced by gold wire bonding by optimizing microstrip line to waveguide (ML-WG) structure. Accordingly, a G-band monolithic integrated power amplifier based on InP HEMT technology was designed and packaged for demonstration. The 3-stage amplifier adopted a balanced topology design and all matching network of the amplifier was done through grounded coplanar planar waveguide (GCPW) transmission lines for reduction of transmission losses and suppression of parasitic substrate modes. It showed that the amplifier could achieve a 3-dB compression saturation output power of 40mW at 215 GHz and behaved good input and output return loss of greater than 20dB. Then, the MMIC was packaged within a cavity where the RF signal was transmitted from waveguides to microstrip circuits based on quartz substrate, then to GSG pads of MMIC through gold ribbon bonding. The ML-WG transition structure could be cleverly used to embed the parasitic effects of gold ribbon bonding through optimization in full-wave electromagnetic simulation software HFSS.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717632","","Wireless communication;Gold;Wires;Power amplifiers;HEMTs;Waveguide discontinuities;Topology","coplanar waveguides;high electron mobility transistors;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;lead bonding;microstrip circuits;microstrip lines;millimetre wave amplifiers;MMIC power amplifiers;rectangular waveguides","parasitic effects;gold ribbon bonding;packaged G-band power amplifier;INP HEMT Technology Utilizing Novel De-Embedding Techniques;terahertz monolithic integrated circuits;TMICs;high-resolution imaging radar;terahertz integrated circuits;practical packaging technology;rectangular waveguides;direct wire bond interconnects;parasitic parameters;gold wire bonding;G-band monolithic integrated power amplifier;3-stage amplifier;balanced topology design;grounded coplanar planar waveguide transmission lines;transmission losses;parasitic substrate modes;output return loss;ML-WG transition structure;compression saturation output power;MMIC;microstrip line to waveguide structure;long-distance high data rate wireless communication;power 40.0 mW;frequency 215.0 GHz;loss 20.0 dB;InP","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, the local electron velocity distribution function becomes anisotropic and the discharge exhibits complex electron dynamics, such as nonlinear effects and resonance phenomena. In the last 50 years, various terminologies have been introduced which are based on theoretical, experimental and computational work in order to study the electron power absorption at low pressure, e.g., stochastic heating, nonlinear electron resonance heating, pressure heating, ambipolar heating, wave-particle-heating and many more.

Multiple cathode spots in vacuum arc move at high speed with evaporation from cathode and interact with each other, which causes the disappearance and generation of the cathode spots unpredictable. Since the movement and interactions of multiple cathode spots in vacuum arc is complex physical phenomenon, the movement factor of multiple cathode spots has not been clarified. Therefore, it has been expected to elucidate this phenomenon by using numerical simulations. Some researchers have researched vacuum arc using 2-D symmetric MHD simulations. However, it cannot simulate the movement and disappearance of multiple cathode spots because the vacuum arc with multiple cathode spots is the asymmetric physical phenomenon. In this research, 3-D electromagnetic thermal fluid simulation was developed in order to elucidate the movement and disappearance of multiple cathode spots in vacuum arc. In this simulation, the current density distribution of cathode spots was determined by the ionic conductivity for the analysis of movement of cathode spots. The initial placement of cathode spots was fixed, the distance among cathode spots was set in the case of narrow distance and wide distance for analysis of constricted arc and diffused arc. As a result, some cathode spots disappeared and caused the of current density increment of the remain cathode spot, which leads to the increment of temperature over one cathode spot. This is because the increment of the conductivity above one cathode spot with increasing vapor concentration from cathode and the number density of electron. This is caused by the joule heating with increasing the current density of one cathode spot. Therefore, the movement and disappearance of multiple cathode spots in vacuum arc can be analyzed by this 3-D electromagnetic thermal fluid simulation.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717718","","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Fluids;Conductivity;Thermal analysis;Numerical models;Electromagnetics","cathodes;current density;numerical analysis;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;vacuum arcs;vacuum circuit breakers","cathode spot;multiple cathode spots;vacuum arc;3-D electromagnetic thermal fluid simulation","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to get details in the process of terahertz emission, a dipole approximation model was proposed to analyze the mechanism of the ponderomotive force-induced terahertz generation process and explain the differences of radiation pattern between one- and two-color cases. In the dipole approximation model, the electric field intensity of dipole radiation takes the form $\overline{E_{THz}}= \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0} c^{2}} \frac{\left([\ddot{\vec P}] \times \overrightarrow{e_{r}}\right) \times \overrightarrow{e_{r}}}{r}$. One can get $\overrightarrow{E_{T H z}} \propto[\ddot{\vec{P}}]$ from this formula, meaning terahertz generation all comes from the variation of dipole moment. According to $[\ddot{\vec{P}}]=2[\dot{Q}][\vec{v}]+[\vec{a}][Q]+ [\ddot{Q}][\vec l]$, the components of $\left[\ddot{\vec P}\right]$ represent different physical processes. The first term denotes a contribution made by directional drift motion of the new born electrons, which is consistent with transient photocurrent model2 applicable to the two-color case. The second term denotes a contribution made by the acceleration motion of charges already generated, which accounts for the terahertz generation mechanism of one-color case and would be verified in this work. In this work, the terahertz generation process in water was numerically simulated by combining the femtosecond breakdown model3 and the rate equation4. The agreement between numerical simulation and experimental results validated the rationality of the model.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717569","","Liquids;Numerical simulation;Laser modes;Mathematical models;Laser excitation;Numerical models;Plasmas","electric breakdown;high-speed optical techniques;laser beam effects;laser beams;numerical analysis;photoconductivity;submillimetre wave generation;terahertz wave generation;terahertz waves;water","dipole approximation model;color cases;liquid water;terahertz wave;intense femtosecond laser beams;experimental phenomena;terahertz emission;ponderomotive force-induced terahertz generation process;two-color case;electric field intensity;dipole radiation;dipole moment;physical processes;transient photocurrent model2;terahertz generation mechanism;one-color case;femtosecond breakdown model;numerical simulation","","","","4","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electric-field-assisted diamond emitters manufactured from semiconductor processes has been recognized as a leading candidate for such compact sources. The micro-scale pyramid structure of the emitter has the desirable attribute of significant electric field enhancement at the sharp interfaces (apex and edges) to facilitate electron emission. We investigate the dependence of field enhancement on the geometric shape. To account for the semiconductor charge transport in the bulk material and the tunneling through the surface, a first-principle semiclassical Monte Carlo emission model is developed and applied to the diamond pyramid. Combining the results from the Monte Carlo and the geometric field enhancement calculation, we construct a simple model to qualitatively explain the measured emission characteristics.1 The electron beam formation and dynamics in a 1D diode setup are simulated with a particle-in-cell code to obtain the macroscopic observables such as the beam energy, voltage, and divergence. The physical characteristics and parametric dependence of the emitted beam are compared with experiments and understood through the analysis of particle trajectory in a model field configuration.2 We further develop an effective mass based theoretical model accounting for the conduction band quantization in a high aspect ratio semiconductor nanostructure and the corresponding Monte Carlo implementation to describe electron transport and subsequent electron emission from the nanotip of the emitter. The effects of level quantization, electron scattering due to the nanotip diameter variation, and electron-phonon scattering on the nanotip emission properties are identified and compared with the case of a bulk slab. 3","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717640","","Semiconductor device modeling;Analytical models;Monte Carlo methods;Voltage measurement;Quantization (signal);Scattering;Tunneling","ab initio calculations;conduction bands;diamond;electron beams;electron field emission;electron-phonon interactions;elemental semiconductors;Monte Carlo methods;nanostructured materials;tunnelling","beam dynamics;single diamond field emitter;compact accelerators;electron microscopy;beam size;ultralow emittance;electric-field-assisted diamond emitters;microscale pyramid structure;electric field enhancement;geometric shape;semiconductor charge transport;first-principle semiclassical Monte Carlo emission model;diamond pyramid;geometric field enhancement calculation;electron beam formation;1D diode setup;particle-in-cell code;beam energy;semiconductor nanostructure;Monte Carlo implementation;electron transport;electron emission;electron-phonon scattering;nanotip emission properties;C","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of these studies is to evaluate if electrical discharges can enhance flames by applying an electrical power negligible compared to the thermal power released by the combustion mechanisms. In this context, non-thermal plasmas were successfully used to enhance the flammability limits, increase the burning velocity, improve ignition, facilitate the transition to detonation and control thermo-acoustic instabilities, in various configurations1. However, the vast majority of these studies were carried out at atmospheric pressure, while in real combustion systems, the pressure is usually in the range from 5 to 40 bar. An increase in pressure above atmospheric can impact both the combustion and the discharge processes. The effects of pressure on combustion phenomena are relatively well known, except for the electrical properties of flames. Indeed, while at atmospheric pressure, the concentration of electrons in hydrocarbon flames is known to be about 1010 cm−3, there is no available data at higher pressure. Similarly, the effect of non-equilibrium discharges on combustion properties at pressures above atmospheric are not well documented. In this study, the effect of non-thermal plasmas produced by nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) discharges on the flammability limit of methane-air flames at pressures up to 8 bar is investigated. The NRP discharges are characterized by current and voltage measurements, while the flame stability is assessed by direct visualization performed with a DSLR camera. The results show that NRP discharges can improve the stability of premixed swirl flames at all pressures investigated, even if the ratio of electrical discharge power to flame thermal power is kept as low as 0.7%. It is also observed that the required peak voltage does not increase linearly with increasing the pressure. Based on physical explanations for these results, the challenges and opportunities of plasma-assisted combustion above atmospheric pressure are discussed.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717741","","Plasma-assisted combustion;Voltage measurement;Conferences;Fires;Ignition;Flammability;Hydrocarbons","combustion;discharges (electric);flames;flammability;ignition;plasma chemistry","flammability limit;electrical discharge power;flame thermal power;atmospheric pressure;combustion enhancement;nonequilibrium plasma discharges;plasma-assisted combustion mechanisms;electrical power;nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges;direct visualization;DSLR camera;hydrocarbon flames;current-voltage measurements;thermo-acoustic instabilities;burning velocity;ignition;pressure 5.0 bar to 40.0 bar;pressure 1.0 atm","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Loosely speaking, with the increase of interelectrodes distance, the value of the spark resistance approaches to an impedance of pulse power source. As a consequence, a discharge regime becomes close to transient and a greater efficiency of shock wave generation is achieved. In this case, a cylindrical coordinates system is used for an analytical model of the underwater spark expansion [1]. However, the experiment observations show the long spark channel finally develops into a spherical bubble. Therefore, the real dynamic of an underwater spark cannot be described as an expanding cylinder. Using of elliptical coordinates allows one to describe the underwater spark channel as an expanding ellipsoid with only one coordinate depending on time [2]. In this study, we compare the numerical results received by using the cylindrical and elliptical coordinates for incompressible approach with the experimental data. Also, we define the region of applicability for both models. An elliptical model provides a close approximation of the spark expansion dynamic observed in the experiment. The model expressed in the cylindrical coordinates gives only approximate estimation of the temporal thickness of the spark channel. After reaching some radius value (usually half of interelectrodes distance) one have to convert a model from cylindrical coordinates to spherical coordinates [3]. The spark channel expressed in the elliptical coordinates gradually transforms from the prolate ellipsoid to spheroid shape. Nevertheless, due to complexity of a shock wave pressure simulation using elliptical coordinates, the cylindrical model remains a main tool for the shock wave calculation for a while.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717518","Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(grant numbers:GA18-12386S); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717518","","Resistance;Shock waves;Shape;Transforms;Fault location;Discharges (electric);Numerical models","bubbles;numerical analysis;plasma shock waves;sparks","elliptical coordinates;underwater spark channel;elliptical model;spark expansion dynamic;spherical coordinates;cylindrical model;mathemetical model;underwater spark simulation;elleptical coordinates;mathematical simulation;underwater discharge;spark resistance;shock wave generation;cylindrical coordinate system;underwater spark expansion;spark channel","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These sensors can be used to detect electric fields from DC or near DC frequencies all the way up to THz frequencies. The EO sensors are made from dielectric electro-optic materials and hence do not disturb measurand electric field. Since no electrical wires are used, they are immune to electromagnetic interferences noise and can be used to measure electric field in highly electromagnetically noisy environments such as inside a plasma reactor. Conventional EO sensors use electro-optic crystal to modulate an optical signal and are based on modulation of polarization components in a bulk crystal1 or modulation of an optical signal in a Mach-Zehnder type optical modulator2. In this paper we introduce novel electro-optic e-field sensor based on an electro-optic micro-ring resonator structure or Mach-Zehnder optical modulator structure that are made on thin film lithium niobate crystals. Thin film lithium niobate crystals have significant advantages compared to the conventional methods for electric field sensing. EO sensors based on micro-ring resonators are extremely compact and can achieve a spatial resolution that is 10–20 times lower than conventional electro-optic sensors. In addition, the sensor can achieve much higher sensitivity compared to conventional electro-optic sensors. Thin film lithium niobate Mach-Zehnder sensors allow perfect phase matching and can be used for detection of THz electric fields. In this talk, we will present the principle of operation of the micro-ring and Mach-Zehnder sensors, their structure and the fabrication procedure for the sensor element, the interrogation system architecture and the performance specifications that we have obtained for these sensors for measuring electric fields.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717620","","Integrated optics;Optical polarization;Electrooptic modulators;Optical device fabrication;Optical resonators;Optical sensors;Optical films","electric field measurement;electric sensing devices;electromagnetic interference;electro-optical devices;electro-optical effects;electro-optical modulation;fibre optic sensors;integrated optics;lithium compounds;Mach-Zehnder interferometers;optical materials;optical modulation;optical resonators;optical sensors;optical waveguides","Mach-Zehnder type optical modulator;e-field sensor;electro-optic microring resonator structure;Mach-Zehnder optical modulator structure;thin film lithium niobate crystals;electric field sensing;conventional electro-optic sensors;Thin film lithium niobate Mach-Zehnder sensors;THz electric fields;electro-optic nanophotonic devices;electro-optic electric-field sensors;electro-optic effect;dielectric electro-optic materials;conventional EO sensors;electro-optic crystal;optical signal","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spectroscopic analysis of inner-shell emission from both “hot” thermal and “cold” nonthermal plasmas can reveal important characteristics of the physical environment. For example, thermal emission from Fe XXVI ions in solar flares reveals hot, highly-ionized stellar plasma conditions1, while nonthermal Fe fluorescence near compact accreting objects reveals cooler, weakly-ionized conditions2. In laboratory Z-pinch plasma, for fixed conditions, nonthermal radiation yield scales more favorably to high atomic numbers and photon energies compared to its thermal counterpart3. Moreover, X-pinches are reliable producers of nonthermal emission in pulse-powered devices at the University scale4–5. In this study, we explore each nonthermal excitation mechanism in a Z-pinch plasma through the manifestation of inner-shell line features and ionization balance. Nonthermal K-shell emission is driven by “hot” energetic electrons or high-energy photons, producing inner-shell vacancies that are filled by upper-level cascades. Previous work suggests that each excitation mechanism manifests specific signatures in spatially-resolved spectra of Z-pinches6. The current work focuses on the spectral ionization characteristics of the $\mathrm{K}\alpha(\mathrm{n}=2\rightarrow 1)$ and $\mathrm{K}\beta (\mathrm{n}=3\rightarrow 1)$ emission lines from nonthermal Fe plasmas. Theoretical analysis is performed with the non-LTE SCRAM code7 to explore independent effects of each excitation process. Theoretical analysis reveals appreciable charge state broadening for variable hot electron abundance (1.0% - 4.0% hot electrons) and photon radiation temperature (40 eV–80 eV). Nonthermal ionization balance shows greater sensitivity to photon radiation temperature compared to fractional abundance of hot electrons. Modeling is applied to experimental Fe plasma produced on the University of Nevada, Reno Zebra Generator to demonstrate hot electron effects.

We present results from basic experiments on heat transport in magnetized plasmas with multiple heat sources in close proximity1. The experiments were carried out at the upgraded Large Plasma Device (LAPD) operated by the Basic Plasma Science Facility at the University of California, Los Angeles. The setup consists of three biased probe-mounted CeB6 crystal cathodes that inject low energy electrons along a strong magnetic field into a pre-existing cold afterglow plasma forming three electron temperature filaments. A triangular spatial pattern is chosen for the thermal sources and multiple axial and transverse probe measurements allow for determination of the cross-field mode patterns and axial filament length. When the three sources are placed within a few collisionless electron skin depths, a non-azimuthally symmetric wave pattern emerges due to the overlap of drift-Alfven modes forming around each filament. This leads to enhanced cross-field transport from nonlinear convective $(\mathrm{E}\times \mathrm{B})$ chaotic mixing and rapid density and temperature profile collapse in the inner triangular region of the filaments. Steepened thermal gradients form in the outer triangular region, which spontaneously generates quasi-symmetric, higher azimuthal mode number drift-Alfven fluctuations. A steady-current model with emissive sheath boundary predicts the plasma potential and shear flow contribution from the sources. A statistical study of the fluctuations reveal amplitude distributions that are skewed which is signature of intermittency in the transport dynamics.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717609","","Temperature measurement;Heating systems;Fluctuations;Predictive models;Plasma measurements;Skin;Plasmas","afterglows;convection;plasma Alfven waves;plasma density;plasma devices;plasma drift waves;plasma fluctuations;plasma instability;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes;shear flow;vortices","multiple interacting magnetized electron temperature filaments;steep thermal gradients;magnetized plasma;drift-Alfven waves;heat transport;heat sources;Large Plasma Device;Basic Plasma Science Facility;pre-existing cold afterglow plasma;triangular spatial pattern;thermal sources;transverse probe measurements;cross-field mode patterns;axial filament length;collisionless electron skin depths;nonazimuthally symmetric wave pattern;drift-Alfven modes;enhanced cross-field transport;temperature profile collapse;inner triangular region;steepened thermal gradients;outer triangular region;plasma potential;shear flow contribution;transport dynamics;high-azimuthal mode number drift-Alfven fluctuations;inject low-energy electrons;biased probe-mounted CeB6 crystal cathodes","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, mechanisms for ozone generation at higher pressures need more thorough understanding. Nanosecond pulsed plasma has been shown to produce higher ozone generation efficiencies than most other forms of electrical discharges1,2. In this report, studies of ozone generation efficiencies of 160g/kWh at atmospheric pressure from a 40kV, 5ns rise time pulse source with ~73mJ pulse energy operating at 1Hz are presented. Additionally, ozone generation efficiencies of 82g/kWh and 5g/kWh are obtained at same pulse settings at 2 atm and 3 atm pressure respectively. It is seen that ozone generation decreases rapidly as one goes above atmospheric pressure. The reason is hypothesized to be a combined effect of lower energy dissipation in the plasma at higher pressures and collisional deactivation mechanisms. Streamers propagate with different speeds at different pressures resulting in changes of plasma conductivity and other transport properties. The reactor impedance increases which in turn increases the mismatch between the reactor and source and affects power transfer efficiency at higher pressures.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717502","","Plasma properties;Gases;Conferences;Energy dissipation;Conductivity;Combustion;Plasmas","ozone;plasma collision processes;plasma materials processing;plasma sources;plasma transport processes","plasma conductivity;ozone generation efficiency;nanosecond pulsed plasma;electrical discharges;time pulse source;pulse energy;energy dissipation;collisional deactivation mechanisms;streamers;pressure 1.0 atm;voltage 40.0 kV;pressure 3.0 atm;time 5.0 ns;frequency 1.0 Hz;pressure 2.0 atm;O3","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy can directly probe the dynamics of photoexcited electrons, enabling the measurement of lifetimes of surface electronic states, such as the image-potential states, via the control of the time delay between the pump and probe photons [3]–[6]. Here, we study the time-resolved photoelectron emission from a dc biased metal surface illuminated by two-color lasers, using a recent quantum mechanical model based on the exact solution of time-dependent Schrödinger equation [7]–[9]. Our calculations recover the experimentally measured photoemission current modulation profile (both magnitude and shape) and reveal the underlying photoemission processes for different dc fields. We find that the dynamics of n-photon excited states due to two-color lasers depends strongly on the applied dc bias. When the dc field is small, all the n-photon orders of the spectra are modulated in the same way as a function of the relative phase delay of the two-color lasers, in agreement with experiments [10]. When dc field increases, various n-photon excited states behave differently with respect to time delay. In the meantime, applying a large dc field to metal surface significantly increases the emission current, which can strongly facilitate the experimental detection of photoelectron emission.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717597","","Spectroscopy;Delay effects;Metals;Measurement by laser beam;Laser modes;Laser excitation;Mathematical models","photoelectron spectra;photoexcitation;Schrodinger equation;surface states;time resolved spectra","surface electronic states;image-potential states;time delay;dc biased metal surface;two-color lasers;quantum mechanical model;time-dependent Schrödinger equation;n-photon excited states;electronic structures;solid surfaces;photoexcited electrons;time-resolved photoelectron emission spectroscopy;photoemission current;relative phase delay","","","","10","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The breakdown results in the formation of self-organized plasma filaments1, 2 that propagates towards the millimeter wave source due to the continuous ionization-diffusion1 and EM wave scattering mechanism. The self-sustained plasma dynamics found a recent application in microwave rocket propulsion3. The phenomena involves multiple time scales (nanoseconds to milliseconds) and length scales (micrometer to millimetre) that comprises the EM-plasma interaction, energy exchanges between plasma and EM waves, and finally, between plasma and surrounding gas. The presence of sharp gradients in electric field and plasma density makes it a computationally difficult multi-scale modeling problem. A tradeoff arises between obtaining accurate results at the cost of high simulation time. Very limited efforts have been made towards an accurate 2D or 3D simulation of such problems involving gas heating. In this work, we describe an efficient mesh refinement based computational technique which can be used to study the complete phenomena of high frequency EM wave breakdown starting from wave-plasma interaction (nanoseconds) to the gas heating stage (microseconds) involving three solvers - Electromagnetic wave solver, plasma solver and a fluid solver. Better understanding of the physics and the mechanisms leading to the complex structures and subsequent propagation of the plasma filaments with high velocity using the proposed tool will be helpful in evaluating and establishing the potential applications.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717908","DST; SERB(grant numbers:CRG/2018/003511); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717908","","Electromagnetic heating;Solid modeling;Rockets;Three-dimensional displays;Electric breakdown;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling","aerospace propulsion;ionisation;plasma density;plasma light propagation;plasma shock waves;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes","gas heating mechanism;complex plasma dynamics;gas heating;self-organized plasma filaments;millimeter wave source;continuous ionization-diffusion;EM wave scattering mechanism;EM-plasma interaction;plasma density;wave-plasma interaction;gas heating stage;plasma solver;electromagnetic wave;high-frequency EM wave breakdown;high-power millimeter wave induced air breakdown;high-power millimeter wave breakdown","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In colloidal systems, substrates are often introduced to manipulate their dynamics, and quite a few new dynamical behaviors have been discovered. Here, using computer simulations, we systematically study the dynamics of two-dimensional dusty plasmas on one-dimensional periodic substrates. First, for the propagation of waves, we find that the propagation of the waves across the potential wells of the substrate is inhibited and the longitudinal motion of an individual chain dominates the propagation of waves along the potential wells of the substrate1. Increasing the width or decreasing the depth of the substrate minima allows the particles to buckle into a zigzag structure, and the resulting spectra develop two branches, one for the sloshing motion and one for the breathing motion1. Second, as the substrate strength increases from zero, the structural order of two-dimensional dusty plasma along each potential well of one-dimensional periodic substrates first increases and then decreases gradually2. From the mean squared displacement of the diffusive behavior along the potential wells, between the initial ballistic and final diffusive motion, there is the subdiffusion at the intermediate time scale, which may result from the substrate-induced distortion of the caging dynamics 2. Third, we focus on the depinning dynamics of this system3. When the applied spatially uniform and temporally constant external driving force increases gradually from zero, quite a few structural and dynamical diagnostics all suggest that there are three different states, which are the pinned, the disordered plastic flow, and the moving ordered states3.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717868","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11875199,11505124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717868","","Conferences;Dynamics;Force;Potential well;Distortion;Dusty plasmas;Plasmas","buckling;colloids;diffusion;dusty plasmas;plastic flow;wave propagation","caging dynamics;depinning dynamics;external driving force;dynamical diagnostics;two-dimensional dusty plasma;one-dimensional periodic substrates;potential wells;longitudinal motion;sloshing motion;breathing motion;ballistic motion;diffusive motion;disordered plastic flow;computer simulations;zigzag structure;wave propagation;colloidal systems;buckling","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We studied thermionic emissi on from a CNT heated by Joule-heating, and found that its th ermionic emission deviates from classical Richardson's law.1 Thermionic emission current from a CNT was measured to b e more than 1 order of magnitude larger than that predicted b y Richardson's law. The phenomenon is attributed to be the e mission of hot electrons generated in CNT under electrical dr ive.2 By employing CNT and graphene as thermionic filamen ts, we have realized the scaling down of thermionic emission source to the microscale on a chip by using microfabrication t echnologies.3-5 Compared to field emission sources, on-chip t hermionic electron sources show advantages of low working voltage, good controllability and low vacuum requirement for stable emission. On-chip thermionic electron sources also ha ve a short turn-on/off response time of less than 1 μs, much s horter than their bulky counterparts. On-chip thermionic elect ron sources open a new route for realizing miniature electron sources for vacuum micro/nano-electronics applications.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717584","","Temperature measurement;Thermionic emission;Graphene;Microfabrication;Vacuum technology;Carbon nanotubes;System-on-chip","carbon nanotubes;electron field emission;electron sources;graphene devices;microfabrication;nanoelectronics;nanotube devices;thermionic electron emission;thermionic emission;vacuum microelectronics;vacuum techniques","on-chip thermionic electron sources;graphene;carbon nanotubes;miniature electron sources;microfabrication technologies;high melting temperature;CNT;stable emission;good electrical conductivity;thermionic electron emission;Joule heating;Richardson law;thermionic emission current;field emission sources;hot electrons emission;thermionic filaments;low working voltage;low vacuum requirement;vacuum microelectronics;vacuum nanoelectronics;C","","","","5","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The underlying electron dynamics is essentially due to the synergistic effects from both the plasma and laser fields in the so-called direct laser acceleration regime. It has wide applicability to a range of laser-plasma interactions, and involves rich phenomena such as betatron resonance, parametric instability, and even stochastic motion. Here, we present analytical and numerical studies of the electron dynamics in betatron resonance based on a simple plasma-channel model. In particular, we clarify the importance of finite electron propagation angle in accessing the resonance between the transverse betatron motion and the laser electric field, and obtain the mapping between the electron initial condition and final resonances for allowed angles. Based on these findings, the electron trapping conditions and the scaling properties of the resonance momentum are derived. In addition, it allows the calculation of the beam divergence for given initial conditions, a crucial parameter for the ignitor beam in fastignition. Ponderomotive phase-space dynamics for the possible resonances is presented and the role of laser strength is addressed. We test these findings with numerical simulations by solving the dynamics for single electron or a beam of electrons. We finally discuss its implications for more self-consistent simulations as well as experimental design for various applications with the required beam properties and efficiency.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717448","LANL; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717448","","Dynamics;Stochastic processes;Production;Neutrons;Laser modes;Numerical simulation;Plasmas","betatrons;fusion reactor ignition;ion accelerators;numerical analysis;plasma accelerators;plasma density;plasma inertial confinement;plasma interactions;plasma light propagation;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;relativistic plasmas","analytical studies;betatron resonance;simple plasma-channel model;finite electron propagation angle;laser electric field;electron initial condition;final resonances;electron trapping conditions;resonance momentum;beam divergence;given initial conditions;ignitor beam;fastignition;ponderomotive phase-space dynamics;possible resonances;laser strength;single electron;required beam properties;plasma channel;electron beams;high-intensity laser pulse;relativistically transparent plasma;high-power laser-based applications;fast ignition;fusion plasmas;bright secondary source;ion acceleration;underlying electron dynamics;direct laser acceleration regime;laser-plasma interactions","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following the needs of the industry, the corresponding discharges tend to be driven by voltages with at least one very high frequency harmonic to increase the ion flux and reactors with increasingly large electrode sizes are used to increase the throughput. However, these trends facilitate enhanced excitation of the surface modes causing the plasma nonuniformity1. The resonant excitation becomes possible due to the nonlinear motion of the sheath and is favored by larger sheath oscillation amplitudes. On the other hand, the surface modes have center-peaked eigenfunctions and self-amplify the plasma nonuniformity by leading to a stronger plasma production and as a result, to a larger sheath width close to the discharge center. The present work considers another mechanism, which might add to the plasma nonuniformity self-amplification, where secondary electrons accelerated by the nonuniform sheath voltage can lead to a stronger plasma generation close to the center.

Self-consistent plasma evolution within electrostatic fields is treated using the Galerkin Finite-Element-Method (FEM) with particle collisions treated using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Modeling the extreme range of length and time scales is made possible by unstructured meshes together with a two-decomposition treatment of the mesh. A static uniform decomposition of the mesh is used for the electrostatic field solves, and a dynamically evolving decomposition of the same mesh is employed for evolving the particles. Rebalancing the particle mesh allows problems involving hundreds of millions of elements and billions of particles to scale well up to thousands of processors on high-performance computers (HPCs).

The DBD working with Ar-NH3 mixture at atmospheric pressure owns some advantages including the low cost and penning effect to generate the homogenous discharge. Therefore, more and more researches focus on the effect of gas mixing ratio on the plasma components, species densities and the discharge modes of Ar/NH3 glow discharge, which reflects the influence of the gas bulk process (e.g. ionization, excitation reactions, etc) on discharge properties1-3, However, there is little researches focus on the effect of the dielectric surface process (e.g. secondary electron emission (SEEC), surface reactions, etc) and permittivity, which are as important as the gas bulk process, on the properties of Ar/NH3glow discharge. In this work, a one-dimensional fluid model of Ar/NH3DBD was established to discuss the discharge mechanism and plasma properties. When we set the gas gap as 4mm, the discharge mode is firstly analyzed under different SEEC and permittivity of the barrier dielectric. Furthermore, plasma products include the intermediate and final products are tracked at each condition. The basic parameters, such as, electron temperature, density of the particles, electric field, yield of the indexed particles, etc., and their distributions in space and time are obtained and discussed.

One of the main challenges associated with this technology is the flame stabilization under lean conditions. Non-thermal plasma discharges have been extensively investigated as a way of stabilizing premixed flames in extremely-lean conditions at atmospheric pressure1. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the ability of this type of discharges to stabilize swirl flames at elevated pressures. This study investigates the influence of nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) plasma discharges on the stability limits of premixed methane-air swirl flames at pressures up to 5 bar. The effects of two discharge regimes, NRP glows and NRP sparks, were analyzed. The voltage and the current of the discharge were measured and the influence of the discharge on the flame stabilization was assessed through direct images of the flames at 60 Hz. Carbon oxide (CO) emissions were also measured with a flue gas analyzer, with and without plasma discharges. Results demonstrated that NRP discharges improved stabilization of premixed swirl flames at elevated pressures even if the ratio of NRP discharge power to flame thermal power equal was 0.7% or less. It was also observed that the peak voltage required to maintain this very low power ratio did not increase linearly with increasing pressure. This was contrary to expectations because increasing pressure should result in a linearly decreasing reduced electric field. Moreover, the relative effectiveness of NRP glow and the NRP spark discharges to extend the flame stability limits changed by increasing pressure. Furthermore, the CO concentration in flue gases was reduced when NRP discharges were used to stabilize the flames. Improved flame stability and reduced CO emissions demonstrated the strong potential of utilizing NRP discharges in gas turbines.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717768","","Voltage measurement;Fires;Plasma measurements;Discharges (electric);Stability analysis;Plasmas;Pollution measurement","combustion;discharges (electric);engines;flames;flue gases;gas turbines;sparks","premixed methane-air swirl flames;flame stabilization;NRP discharge power;flame thermal power;NRP spark discharges;high-pressure premixed lean combustion;nonthermal plasma discharges;atmospheric pressure;nanosecond repetitively pulsed plasma discharges;gas turbines","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the global warming potential of SF6 used in GCB(Gas Circuit Breaker) is 22800 times higher than that of CO2, which imposes the heavy burden on the environment. Thus, improved ACB(Air Circuit Breaker) performance is demanded in order to reduce the burden on the environment. The polymer material is used for the nozzle of ACB. The polymer is ablated by the heat and radiation of arc. The arc is cooled by ablation gas because of the energy loss such as the dissociation. In addition, it has been reported that the arc resistance increases because the spiral arc is formed by applying the axial magnetic field in the process of decreasing the current. Therefore, the current interruption performance is able to be expected by focusing the ablation and spiral arc. In this paper, the temperature distribution and ablation gas concentration distribution under consideration of nozzle ablation caused by the spiral arc applied the axial magnetic field is elucidated. In this calculation, atmosphere gas is N2 and the ablation gas generated from nozzle is POM. The parameter of this calculation is axial magnetic field. In addition, the transient recovery voltage is applied in post arc in order to simulate the success of failure of the current interruption. This calculation dose not generate the ablation gas affected by the radiation transfer. As a result, the spiral arc was formed by the increasing axial magnetic field. On the other hand, the ablation gas generating position of nozzle changed because of changing the high temperature position of arc. In addition, the arc voltage increased owing to the spiral arc and the arc was locally cooled by the ablation gas. Therefore, the current interruption performance was improved considering both the ablation and axial magnetic field compared to only considering either one.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717633","","Resistance;Temperature distribution;Spirals;Circuit breakers;Sulfur hexafluoride;Voltage;Magnetic fields","air blast circuit breakers;circuit-breaking arcs;cooling;global warming;magnetic fields;nozzles;polymers;temperature distribution;transients","temperature distribution;nozzle ablation;arc resistance;current interruption performance;atmosphere gas;axial magnetic field;ablation gas;circuit breaker;power system;global warming;polymer material;spiral ARC;POM;transient recovery voltage;GCB","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Speed-limited PIC (SLPIC) approach is a modification of PIC that can speed up simulation by roughly the square root of the ion/electron mass ratio. In a steady state, this approach is equivalent to the numerical timestepping method, which evolves electrons and ions using different timesteps; for steady-state electrostatic simulations, this method can be realized simply by performing a simulation with electrons and positrons (reduced-mass ions), and scaling the resulting ion velocities and currents appropriately. However, SLPIC offers a way to simulate slow time-dependence as well as the steady state. We demonstrate these approaches by simulating a Langmuir probe in electron-argon plasma, reducing simulation time by more than a factor of 100.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717901","","Temperature measurement;Space vehicles;US Department of Energy;Computational modeling;Positrons;Ions;Plasmas","argon;astrophysical plasma;Langmuir probes;plasma collision processes;plasma density;plasma kinetic theory;plasma probes;plasma simulation;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes","numerical timestepping method;different timesteps;steady-state electrostatic simulations;reduced-mass ions;resulting ion velocities;SLPIC;slow time-dependence;steady state;Langmuir probe;electron-argon plasma;simulation time;modeling plasma probes;Speed-Limited Particle-In-Cell Simulation;density;space plasmas;probe data;nonideal plasma conditions;complicated geometry;nonzero electric fields;magnetic fields;moderate collisionality;secondary emission;particle-in-cell simulations;excessive computation time;Speed-limited PIC approach;roughly the square root","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their advantage is assigned to the simultaneous generation of ions, metastables, radiation, reactive oxygennitrogen species, [2]. Among others, AAPJs operating in Ar are considered of high commercial potential in medicine due to relatively low operational costs. Nevertheless, UV radiation from argon excimers Ar2* is always present in such sources, limiting its possible utilization and rising concerns on device safety. For this reason, a detailed study on UV/VUV radiation generation in argon plasmas and its biological effect is important for the optimization of the treatment and end user applications. Accordingly, we developed radio-frequency RF APPJ, designed in annular geometry that allows aerosol introduction in the plasma effluent. In this work, the production of UV/VUV radiation in the plasma region and its contribution to the total plasma biological effect during fibroblast cells and plasmid DNA treatment have been studied. The study of UV biological effect was performed by a combination of VUV spectroscopy with fluorescence imaging of the treatment patterns on artificial skin, and finally in-vitro tests. Special attention has been given to the effect of aerosol presence on UV transport to the treated sample. It was revealed that UV radiation is dominated at deep UV below 200 nm by Ar2*, OI followed by lower intensity bands located at the region above 250 nm and attributed to NO and N2 excited states emission. It has been shown that Ar2* and OI originate from the active plasma, while NO and N2 emission is due to air intrusion. Presence of the aerosol has strong effect on UV absorption, reducing the UV radiation effect on cells viability and plasmid DNA defragmentation. The use of RF plasma in combination with an aerosol is proposed as a tool to control the plasma side effects attributed to presence of VUV/UV radiation.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717874","","Radio frequency;Spectroscopy;Shape;DNA;Aerosols;Wounds;Biology","aerosols;argon;cellular biophysics;diseases;DNA;excimers;excited states;fluorescence;patient treatment;plasma applications;plasma diagnostics;plasma jets;skin;ultraviolet radiation effects;ultraviolet spectra;wounds","annular shape RF jet;UV emission control;biomedical application;atmospheric pressure plasma jets;autoimmune disease treatments;reactive oxygennitrogen species;AAPJs operating;argon plasmas;radio-frequency RF APPJ;annular geometry;aerosol introduction;plasma effluent;plasma region;plasma biological effect;plasmid DNA treatment;UV biological effect;VUV spectroscopy;treatment patterns;aerosol presence;UV transport;deep UV;UV absorption;UV radiation effect;RF plasma;plasma side effects;N2 excited states emission","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the stable and reliable supply of electric power has been indispensable for the industry with the sophistication of the industry. The accident current causes the instantaneous voltage drop when the accident occurs in the power system such as a lightning surge or short-circuit fault. The power equipments would be badly damaged by this phenomenon. Therefore, it is important to interrupt the fault current as soon as possible, and GCBs are used for current interruption. GCBs are used for interruption the current and protect the power equipments and power systems. The arc heated gas is exhausted in two opposite directions in order to extinguish the arc plasma. The arc is extended by the two opposite convections, and the gas flow improves arc quenching. It has been reported that the arc cooling caused by blowing gas in the axial direction to the arc in order to improve the characteristics of current interruption. The research of gas flow is important because the convection is a major source of energy loss in the double-flow gas circuit breakers. However, the convection to outlet of ring electrode for arc extinction in the double-flow gas circuit breaker is not elucidated. Thus, it is important to research the flow velocity with changing the nozzle shape in order to improve the performance of current interruption. In this research, arc temperature distribution was calculated with changing the nozzle shape. The parameter of this simulation is gas blaster angle.

The quantum effects in plasmas become significant, when the associated de Broglie wavelength of the particles is comparable to the inter-particle distance Dust grains are universal in various parts of our cosmic environment, such as in the planetary ring system of Saturn, in Jupiter's moon and in the dust rings of the Martian moon etc. The presence of highly charged dust grains in plasmas give rise to different kinds of wave modes; dust-ion acoustic mode (DIA) is one of such modes under present study. The Quantum Hydrodynamic (QHD) model is useful approximation to study various kind of nonlinear phenomena in quantum dusty plasmas. In present investigation, we have analyzed the interaction of dust ion-acoustic (DIA) shock waves in quantum plasma whose constituents are electrons and ions showing quantum behavior and negatively charged dust grains. The ions and dust grains are assumed to be mobile and quantum electrons are considered to be inertialess. Using an extended Poincare-Lighthill-Kuo perturbation method, two sided KdV-Burgers equations for shock waves are derived. The analytical phase shifts of DIA shock waves after collision have also been deduced. The impacts of physical parameters such as the quantum diffraction parameter for electrons and ions, kinematic viscosity which arises due to dust charge variation, the unperturbed dust to ion density ratio, and temperature ratio on the phase shifts occurred during the head-on collision between DIA shock waves are analyzed. Only positive potential shocks are observed. Amplitude and width of DIA shocks are enhanced with change in number density ratio. The phase shift is also increased with increase in number density and ion viscosity parameter.

Oscillations in the initial 200 ns of the current pulse are a possible cause of this disordering and we discuss possible mitigations. The impedance of the FF-1 and FF-2B devices at the pinch for both the 10cm and 14cm electrodes was correlated with the fusion yield. To obtain improved neutron yield with beryllium electrodes, we are reducing the inductance of the machine with a doubling of the number of switches.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717885","","Electrodes;Inductance;Limiting;Impurities;Beryllium;Neutrons;Plasmas","beryllium;copper;electrodes;optimisation;pinch effect;plasma focus;plasma impurities;plasma oscillations;plasma sheaths;plasma transport processes;tungsten","dense plasma focus FF-2B;low-impurity fusion device;electrode erosion;current sheath;current pulse;neutron yield;FF-1 devices;monolithic beryllium electrodes;mega-ampere DPF optimization;oscillations;machine inductance reduction;pinch effect;size 14.0 cm;current 1.2 MA;time 200.0 ns;size 10.0 cm;Be","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such high-frequency functional devices are useful for developing magnetic data storage. However, active phase switching control of these spins lies at the heart of these applications and realizing the same in terahertz emission is challenging. A recent study has demonstrated that the phase reversal of terahertz radiation can be optically achieved by changing the helicity of the circularly polarized light. In this direction, we show a unique optical pathway to switch the phase of the emitted terahertz radiation by employing the thermal effect of pump laser on the sample. In this work, fluence dependent reconfigurable terahertz has been successfully demonstrated through the magneto-optically controlled behaviour of emitter [2].

For the poly-W samples, SEM images showed the extent of surface and subsurface of W damage due to helium flux irradiation. The increase in numbers of hydrogen shots results in micro-cracks and blisters on the sample surface followed by re-solidification of the sputtered and melted surface. Nanostructurization of W has been achieved by exposing the W samples to Argon plasma in the UNU/ICPT DPF device to improve the performance. This results in well-distributed highly dense nanoparticles of ∼ 20–50 nm size. He ions exposed nano-W samples showed micro-cracks and nanopores, instead of blisters and holes.

The hot air plasma was generated at a distance of up to 1 mm ahead of the Al target which expands supersonically along both backward and forward direction along the laser propagation axis. Later, this rapidly expanding forward moving plasma interacts with the thick (1 mm) Al slab resulted in a dynamic interaction between the reflected plasma and the air plasma. These resulted in the propagation of multiple compression waves through the Al material that varied with input laser energy. The simulated results highlight on the response of a material to the dynamic loadings (shock), compression wave propagation into the Al target as well as the thermal response.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717594","","Propagation;Lasers;Loading;Aerodynamics;Numerical simulation;Plasmas;Thermal loading","aluminium;drag reduction;hydrodynamics;numerical analysis;plasma production by laser;plasma shock waves;plasma simulation;supersonic flow","reflected plasma;input laser energy;compression wave propagation;1D numerical simulation;laser produced air plasma interaction;fusion experiments;high-speed aerodynamic flows;blunt bodies;bulk metallic target;modified MULTIfs radiation hydrodynamic code;laser parameters;hot air plasma;laser propagation axis;dynamic interaction","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this contribution, very low-current (0.1-1 A) cathodes with LaB6 knife-edge emitters of various geometrical dimensions (emissive area, emitter orifice diameter and aspect ratio, keeper orifice diameter and aspect ratio) are systematically tested in the attempt of constructing a set of scaling laws that link geometrical characteristics with operational parameters and cathode discharge plasma properties.

Moreover, particular attention is paid to the cathodes' stability regions in terms of discharge mode and mode transition across a range of emission currents and xenon and krypton mass flow rates.

Although active metasurfaces have already been demonstrated through functional materials integration, they are still far from sufficient to realize fully reconfigurable functionalities. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a spatio-temporal modulated reflectarray metasurface that is capable of dynamical wave-front shaping and nonreciprocal propagation of free space electromagnetic radiation. Arbitrary space-time phase distributions in reflection are achieved by embedding electronically modulated varactors into the resonators of our metasurface. Our experimental measurements reveal on-demand wave-front control of frequency conversion processes. We also demonstrate maximum violation of Lorentz reciprocity in both beam steering and focusing due to nonreciprocal excitation of surface plasmons. We developed an analytical generalized Bloch-Floquet theory valid for arbitrary two-dimensional spatial modulations.

The needle was located between two quartz slides with a gap distance of 2 mm. Due to the formation and subsequent growth of a vapor bubble becoming as large as 8 mm1 in the direction of the laser beam, the bubble occupies the entire gap and expands along the inner wall of quartz windows. During this bubble expansion, a UV laser beam around 282 nm was passed through the bubble and an ICCD camera with a narrowband filter (310–320 nm) was capturing the spatially resolved LIF signal along the laser beam.

A sensitivity analysis of microscale gas breakdown theory demonstrated that work function (WF) and field enhancement played the largest role in influencing gas breakdown voltage when field emission dominated breakdown [1]. The WF used in these theories is typically for a flat surface; however, really electrodes may exhibit surface roughness that causes variations in WF. Previous theoretical studies using a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP)-based mathematical model demonstrated that the measured WF for a surface with sinusoidal surface roughness may differ from the WF for a perfectly smooth surface [2]. However, this model never explicitly addressed the periodicity of the surface roughness, which may become important for very small devices where the SKP step size may be on the order of the surface roughness period or, for breakdown experiments, the periodicity may influence the effective WF near the discharge area. Extending the theory to explicitly consider triangular defects and sine-squared defects shows that the period and constant presence of surface roughness, rather than the precise surface roughness topology, drives WF behavior. Potential applications of the model, such as incorporating it into a universal theory or particle simulations for gas breakdown [3] and further examining nanoscale devices will be discussed.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717932","ONR(grant numbers:N00014-17-1-2702); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717932","","Surface discharges;Electric breakdown;Shape;Sensitivity analysis;Surface roughness;Mathematical models;Rough surfaces","electric breakdown;nanostructured materials;nanotechnology;plasma simulation;silicon compounds;surface roughness;work function","work function;surface roughness period;surface electrical behavior;nanotechnology;microscale gas breakdown theory;field enhancement;gas breakdown voltage;flat surface;measured WF;sinusoidal surface roughness;periodicity;breakdown experiments;physical behavior;chemical behavior;sensitivity analysis;field emission;scanning Kelvin probe-based mathematical model;discharge area;surface roughness topology;smooth surface;nanoscale devices","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the field between cathode and anode exceeds the explosive field emission threshold, seed electrons are emitted from the emission sites, and then impact ionization in gas takes over, and eventually the voltage on anode changes when the electrons arrive. The value of such simulation is that if spark gap can be simulated, then an entire pulsed power system can be simulated, including pulse forming line connected to a spark gap and then to a high power microwave source, all in one simulation.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717588","","Spark gaps;Power transmission lines;Switches;Threshold voltage;Semiconductor process modeling;Plasmas;Anodes","electric breakdown;electrochemical electrodes;electron field emission;power transmission lines;pulse generators;pulsed power supplies;pulsed power switches;spark gaps","spark gap;anode-cathode gap;particle-in-cell simulation;pulsed power system;self-breakdown voltage;transmission line;explosive field emission threshold;high power microwave source","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, the birthrate is declining and aging. Thus, the number of technicians will decrease, and the automation of welding has become widespread. In the automation of welding, it is important to improve the moving speed of the torch and the efficiency of welding. However, the arc cannot follow the high speeding movement of the torch, and it will cause the welding defect such as a re-striking. Thus, the method of applying an external magnetic field to the arc has been studied. When the transverse magnetic field is applied, the arc is deflected by the electromagnetic force and is controlled to direction of the torch movement because of preventing weld defects. It is difficult to apply a transverse magnetic field in actual welding. Thus, we focus on the diagonal magnetic fields. In this paper, the arc deflection length affected by the diagonal magnetic field in 3D electromagnetic thermal simulation is calculated. As a result, the arc deflection length increased with increasing the magnetic flux density of the diagonal magnetic field. Also, the arc deflection length affected by the diagonal magnetic field was decreased as compared to the transverse magnetic field.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717492","","Solid modeling;Magnetic flux density;Three-dimensional displays;Automation;Fluids;Welding;Metals","arc welding;electromagnetic forces;magnetic flux;quality control;welds","transverse magnetic field;diagonal magnetic field;3D electromagnetic thermal fluid simulation;TIG arc welding;welding defect;external magnetic field;weld defects;arc deflection length;electromagnetic force;torch movement;magnetic flux density","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reflection of the shock wave from the boundary walls has led to squeezing of the plasma which is effectively changing the hot core air plasma and the resulting SW dynamics.

We find that the dcMS deposition rate is only weakly sensitive to variations in the magnetic field while the deposition rate during HiPIMS operated in fixed voltage mode changed from 30% to 90% of the dcMS deposition rate as |B| decreased. In contrast, when operating the HiPIMS discharge in fixed peak current mode, the deposition rate increased only slightly with decreasing |B|. In fixed voltage mode, for weaker $\vert \mathrm{B}\vert, $ the higher was the deposition rate, the lower was the $F_{\text{flux}}$. In the fixed peak current mode, both deposition rate and $F_{\text{flux}}$ increased with decreasing |B|. We observe a significant deposition of the film forming material perpendicular to the target surface. This sideways deposition decreases with increasing axial distance from the target surface. The sideways deposition rate is always the highest in dc operation while it is lower for HiPIMS operation. The magnetic field strength has a strong influence on the sideways deposition rate in HiPIMS but not in dcMS2. Furthermore, in HiPIMS operation the radial ion deposition rate is always at least as large as the axial ion deposition rate, and often around two times higher. Thus there are significantly higher number of ions traveling radially in the HiPIMS discharge. We demonstrate that the total radial flux of film forming material is greater in dcMS compared to HiPIMS for almost all cases investigated. We therefore conclude that the commonly reported reduction of the (axial) deposition rate in HiPIMS compared to dcMS does not seem to be linked with an increase in sideways material transport in HiPIMS.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717426","","Geometry;Magnetic flux;Voltage;Titanium;Ions;Discharges (electric);Plasmas","discharges (electric);magnetic field effects;metallic thin films;sputter deposition;titanium","magnetic field strength;HiPIMS discharges;fixed voltage mode;fixed peak current mode;radial ion deposition rate;axial ion deposition rate;dc magnetron sputtering;high power impulse magnetron sputtering;total radial flux;titanium;geometry;ionized flux fraction;Ti","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High densities and temperatures should result through plasma compression from increasing the current. However, virulent pressure-driven instabilities quickly destroy the equilibrium and impede the path to a viable fusion device for the traditional Z pinch. Introducing a sheared axial flow to the plasma was theorized to stabilize the Z pinch. Closely coupled with computational studies, Z-pinch experiments at the University of Washington tested the theory of sheared-flow stabilization. Measurements of the plasma equilibrium and stability confirmed that in the presence of a sufficiently large flow-shear, gross Z-pinch instabilities were mitigated, and radial force balance was achieved. Z-pinch plasmas were held stable for durations much longer than predicted for a static plasma, i.e. stable for thousands of instability growth times. Experimental results were combined with adiabatic scaling relations and detailed single-fluid, multi-fluid, and kinetic computational studies to explore the limits of possible plasma properties that may be achieved in a sheared-flow-stabilized (SFS) Z pinch. The improved understanding of stabilization provided a means of increasing plasma parameters, e.g. $\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{e}} > 1\mathrm{e}17\ /\text{cc}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{i}} > 1$ keV. The collaborative FuZE (Fusion Z-pinch Experiment) project between UW and LLNL scaled the SFS Z pinch to fusion conditions. Results have demonstrated that fusion reactions are sustained along a 50-cm long Z-pinch deuterium plasma. Steady neutron production1 was observed for durations up to 8 microseconds during which the plasma was stable, and the current was sufficiently high to compress the plasma to fusion conditions. The neutron production was demonstrated to be consistent with a thermonuclear fusion process. Increasing the pinch current has demonstrated a corresponding increase in neutron yield. The dependence of yield on current will be presented and compared to theoretical scaling relations and numerical simulations. Experimental observations generally agree with theoretical and computational predictions, indicating that sheared flows can stabilize and sustain a Z-pinch equilibrium and offering a potential path to achieve even higher performing plasmas.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717944","ARPA-E; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717944","","Performance evaluation;Production;Neutrons;Plasma measurements;Numerical simulation;Stability analysis;Plasmas","deuterium;plasma instability;plasma kinetic theory;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma pressure;plasma simulation;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes;shear flow;Tokamak devices;Z pinch","thermonuclear fusion;pinch current;Z-pinch equilibrium;sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch;compact fusion device;axial flow;plasma equilibrium;Z-pinch instabilities;radial force balance;Z-pinch plasmas;static plasma;adiabatic scaling relations;kinetic computational studies;fusion Z-pinch experiment;SFS Z pinch;Z-pinch deuterium plasma;neutron production;time 8.0 mus;D","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A broad range of optical pump wavelength from UV to near IR region, including the communication wavelength $(\sim 1.5 \mu \mathrm{m})$ is usable [3]–[4].

The PIC method is used to track the four major particles in the discharge chamber, including primary electrons, secondary electrons, ions and neutral atoms. The MCC method is used to describe the collisions between particles, the elastic, excitation and ionization collisions for electrons, and the elastic and charge exchange collisions for ions are considered. The motion of charged particles is affected by dynamic electric field and external magnetic field, in which the electric field is obtained by solving Poisson equation with DADI (Dynamic Alternating Direction Implicit Iteration) method2. Such a full kinetic model is challenging because it requires a huge number of grids and computation time. Therefore, a self-similar scaling scheme proposed by Taccogna is used to simplify the discharge chamber model3. This scaling scheme reduces the size of discharge chamber while keeping the main physical parameters (Knudsen number, specific impulse, and electron magnetization process) unchanged. It shortens the computation time and is helpful for analyzing the actual physical characteristics of the discharge chamber. In this work, a 20-cm diameter axisymmetric cylindrical model with three rings of magnets is established to test the discharge chamber.

Resembling traditional thermionic emission sources based on a hot tungsten filament, Joule-heated carbon nanotube can function as filament material of nanoscale electron source because of its excellent thermal stability and electrical conductivity. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of high-performance on-chip thermionic electron micro-emitter arrays by utilizing microfabrication technologies and exploiting suspended carbon nanotube arrays as thermionic filaments.1 For single micro-emitter, an electron emission density up to $\approx 1.33$ A $\text{cm}^{-2}$ is obtained at a low-driven voltage $(\approx 4\mathrm{V})$. The turn-on/off time is measured to be less than $1\ \mu \mathrm{s}$, because thermal inertia of filament is greatly reduced compared with their bulky counterparts. Particularly, stable $(\pm 1.2\%$) emission current fluctuation for 30 min) and reproducible $(\pm 0.2\%$ driven voltage variation over 27 cycles) electron emission have been experimentally observed under a low vacuum of $\approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ Pa. Even under a rough vacuum of $\approx 10^{-1}$ Pa, an impressive reproducibility ($\pm 2\%$ driven voltage variation over 20 cycles) is obtained. Moreover, emission performances of micro-emitter arrays are found to exhibit good uniformity in wafer scale. The outstanding stability, reproducibility and uniformity of our carbon nanotube based thermionic electron micro-emitter imply their promising applications as on-chip integrated electron sources.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717549","","Thermionic emission;Tungsten;Carbon nanotubes;Thermal conductivity;Reproducibility of results;Time measurement;System-on-chip","carbon nanotubes;electrical conductivity;electron sources;field emitter arrays;heat treatment;microfabrication;nanofabrication;thermal stability;thermionic electron emission;thin films","thermionic filaments;single microemitter;electron emission density;low-driven voltage;on-chip integrated electron sources;carbon nanotube films;high electron-emitting performance;thermionic emission sources;Joule-heated carbon nanotube;filament material;nanoscale electron source;on-chip thermionic electron microemitter arrays;thermal stability;electrical conductivity;microfabrication;suspended carbon nanotube arrays;turn-on-off time;thermal inertia;stable emission current fluctuation;reproducibility;time 30.0 min;C","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we used a needle-plate reactor which was powered by microsecond pulsed spark discharge, and model compounds dripped from a flexible pipe tied to the needle. N-decane, 1-methylnaphthalene, FCC LCO considered as model compounds of heavy oil cracking process were developed in the absence of catalyst and we evaluated the effect of gas species, pulse frequencies, feed volume on the production rate of the hydrogen. By increasing pulse frequencies, the production rate of the hydrogen was increased in all atmospheres. The mainly gaseous products were hydrogen, acetylene, ethylene and methane. $\mathrm{C}_{2},\ \mathrm{H}_{\alpha},\ H_{\beta}$ were found in the OES, which confirmed that the model compounds were cracked into hydrogen and light hydrocarbon fractions. Compared with methane and hydrogen atmospheres, applied power can be decreased efficaciously by adding argon to methane and hydrogen atmospheres. The mixing ratio of hydrogen and argon directly affected applied power and energy consumption.

Recent efforts have linked multiple mechanisms to determine when detailed numerical solutions or simulations are necessary rather than the well-known simple equations. One study incorporated collisions into the transition from space-charge-limited emission (SCLE) to field emission to link the Child-Langmuir (CL), Mott-Gurney (MG), and Fowler-Nordheim (FN) laws, defining nexuses where two or three asymptotes intersect1. Another study included quantum SCLE and Paschen's law (PL) law to these conditions2. More recently, we have incorporated thermo-field emission to link the Richardson-Laue-Dushman law to CL and FN, and then demonstrate additional nexuses with MG and Ohm's law3. Here, we summarize these approaches and demonstrate their importance for determining the appropriate emission condition for various scenarios. Generally, a mechanism significantly influences current-voltage curves for approximately an order of magnitude from a nexus.

Thus the mitigation is of paramount importance, which requires a proper identification of the disruption precursors. Using new machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, it is possible to identify disruption precursors, however, such approaches require training the ML/AI models. This training of models requires a huge amount of experimental data, which sometimes may not be sufficient due to variation in the current quench profile across different tokamak. This necessitates the need for accurate synthetic current quench data generation for different types of the CQ profiles observed experimentally. We propose a novel approach for synthetic CQ data generation, wherein the set of experimental current quench data is clustered into groups with similar patterns and each cluster, rather than the entire set, is employed as a base for generating more realistic and accurate synthetic data consisting of all important current quench shape aspects. The synthetically generated data is evaluated and categorized as disruption, soft landing, or step landing with multiple slopes. The disruption data set is further analyzed qualitatively for the CQ nature - exponential, linear, or Gaussian. The quantification of the minimum number of experimental data sets and it's time resolution for generating meaningful synthetic data are also explored. The typical current quench parameters namely average CQ rate $(QR_{90-10})$, instantaneous CQ $((dI_{p}/dt)$, CQ time ($\tau$) have been estimated for the synthetic data, and subsequent comparison with the experimental parameter across different tokamak CQ has been found to be in a fair agreement.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717721","","Training;Shape;Thermal quenching;Machine learning;Electromagnetic forces;Thermal force;Tokamak devices","electromagnetic forces;plasma toroidal confinement;Tokamak devices","tokamak plasma current quench;plasma device;disruption precursors;synthetic CQ data generation;disruption data set;experimental parameter;plasma current quench studies;tokamak CQ;synthetic current quench data generation","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These helically oriented magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instabilities in MagLIF have been mitigated by use of dielectric coatings on the outer surface of the metallic liner; the coatings are thought to reduce growth of electrothermal instability (ETI) structures, hypothesized to be an important pre-implosion seed for subsequent MRT growth. Use of dynamic drive magnetic field polarization via a dynamic screw pinch is proposed to reduce cumulative MRT growth in-flight during liner acceleration, providing a novel means to improve implosion stability. This concept has been explored analytically [1] and numerically [2] with focus on establishing the physics design basis for exploration in experiments on the Z accelerator. We present results from three-dimensional high resolution magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that focus on modeling MRT development in liner implosions driven by azimuthal and axial magnetic field components; as the liner implodes, the azimuthal component (inversely proportional to the liner radius) increases and the initially-helical drive magnetic vector field polarization dynamically rotates towards the equator. Cumulative growth, wavelength, and orientation of MRT are compared for simulations with different specified drive field ratios (axial drive magnetic field component divided by azimuthal drive magnetic field component measured at the imploding liner surface). Select results are compared to the linear theory [1]. The stabilizing effects of dynamic magnetic field polarization observed in MHD simulations indicate that dynamic screw pinches deserve further experimental study as a viable mechanism for effectively improving implosion uniformity in magnetically driven liner implosions.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717531","Sandia National Laboratories; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717531","","Solid modeling;Magnetohydrodynamics;Magnetic field measurement;Surface waves;Magnetic confinement;Wavelength measurement;Fasteners","explosions;plasma accelerators;plasma heating;plasma inertial confinement;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma shock waves;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;Rayleigh-Taylor instability;Z pinch","dielectric coatings;metallic liner;electrothermal instability structures;important pre-implosion seed;MRT growth;dynamic drive magnetic field polarization;dynamic screw pinch;cumulative MRT growth;liner acceleration;implosion stability;physics design basis;three-dimensional high resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations;modeling MRT development;azimuthal field components;axial magnetic field components;azimuthal component;liner radius;initially-helical drive magnetic vector field polarization;cumulative growth;different specified drive field ratios;axial drive magnetic field component;azimuthal drive magnetic field component;imploding liner surface;stabilizing effects;dynamic magnetic field polarization;implosion uniformity;magnetically driven liner implosions;magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability development;three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic modeling;enhanced hydrodynamic instabilities;effect fuel compression;fusion yield;magnetized liner inertial fusion;helically oriented magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities;solid liner dynamic screw pinches;Z accelerator","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enhance the surface electric withstanding s trength of ER, TiN is coated by plasma-enhanced magnetron sputtering in a coating system. A highly purified (99.99%) TiN compound target is chosen as a sputtering source; N2 (purity: 99.999%) is introduced as reactive gas. Sputtering times are set as 228s and 22s. The flashover characteristics, secondary e lectron emission (SEE) characteristics and surface charge accu mulation behaviors of coated ER samples are investigated. TiN coating can significantly improve the flashover withstanding strengths of ER samples. When the sputtering time is 22s, the first breakdown voltage $U_{fb}$, conditioned voltage $U_{co}$ and hold-off voltage $U_{ho}$ increase by 19.14%, 39.43% and 46.26%; when the sputtering time increases to 228s, the $U_{fb},\ U_{co}$ and $U_{ho}$ furtherly increase by 61.75%, 49.82% and 70.07% compared with virgin samples. TiN coatings also suppress secondary electron emission and lower the surface secondary electron yield (SEY). After 22s and 228s sputtering, the maximum SEY decreases by 16.97% and 20.21% compared with that of the virgin sample. Furthermore, the surface charge accumulation on coating ER samples is remarkably prohibited and the maximum surface charge density decreases from 77.84 pC/mm2 to 4.27 pC/mm2. In summary, SEE is suppressed, both the amplitude and the range of surface charge accumulation are reduced and thus the surface flashover strength is promoted. In conclusion, plasma-enhanced magnetron sputtering is an effective method to enha nce the flashover strength of insulating materials like ER. It can promote the overall performance of the insulation system and the development of high-voltage electrical equipment.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717947","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11775175,51777165,U1766218,51827809); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717947","","Insulation;Breakdown voltage;Tin compounds;Epoxy resins;Flashover;Power systems;Plasmas","flashover;polymers;resins;secondary electron emission;sputter deposition;sputtered coatings;surface charging;titanium compounds","plasma-enhanced magnetron sputtering;sputtering source;sputtering time;surface secondary electron yield;surface charge accumulation;surface charge density;surface flashover strength;high-voltage electrical equipment;surface charge suppression;surface insulation strength enhancement;epoxy resin;high-voltage energy transmission;surface electric;secondary electron emission;time 228.0 s;time 22.0 s;TiN","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Until now, only qualitative descriptions of the underlying mechanisms for this behavior could be presented. A one-dimensional fluid model (including spherically symmetric geometry) was applied in a general treatment of the problem, and it was concluded that the pressure at the wall should equal the electron pressure in the center of the discharge [3]. However, the found systematic deviations remained unexplained.

This concept was proposed to control magnetically driven Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (MRTI) in Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF), where an initially solid-metal liner is imploded onto preheated, premagnetized fusion fuel. During a MagLIF implosion, MRTI forms on the liner's outer surface and can feed through to the liner's inner surface, thus perturbing the fusion fuel inside. Using the 1-MA, 100-200-ns COBRA pulsed-power driver at Cornell, we tested three DSP cases (with peak axial magnetic fields of 2 T, 14 T, and 20 T) as well as a standard z-pinch case. The liners were made from 650-nm-thick aluminum foil. Images collected during the experiments reveal that helical MRTI modes ($m > 0$) developed in the DSP cases while azimuthally symmetric MRTI modes ($m=0$) developed in the standard z-pinch case. Additionally, the MRTI amplitudes for the 14-T and 20-T DSP cases were smaller than in the standard z-pinch case by factors of about 2 and 3, respectively, at a convergence ratio of 2. Calculated growth rates from the data were also compared to the theoretical growth rates for both thick and thin shell cylindrical MRTI.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717832","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:PHY-1705418); NNSA; DOE Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:DE-NA0003764); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717832","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Conferences;Aluminum;Fasteners;Plasmas;Fuels;Magnetic fields","aluminium;explosions;plasma diagnostics;plasma inertial confinement;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;Rayleigh-Taylor instability;Z pinch","standard z-pinch case;MRTI amplitudes;DSP cases;shell cylindrical MRTI;magneto Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities;dynamic screw pinch;Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion;solid-metal liner;premagnetized fusion fuel;MagLIF implosion;MRTI forms;fusion fuel inside;100-200-ns COBRA pulsed-power driver;peak axial magnetic fields;liners;helical MRTI modes;azimuthally symmetric MRTI modes","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although a variety of security systems have been developed, it is still difficult to reach the level of large-scale commercial application. The reason is not only the lack of radiometer performance, but also the insufficiency of obtained information (e.g., single or dual polarization and single frequency band data). When the radiometer hardware performance is given, how to improve detectivity is an important problem to be resolved. Multi-polarization imaging might contribute to improve the imaging performance. In this paper, we have constructed a novel experiment system of W-band passive imaging, which can generate multiple polarization images. The imaging system mainly contains a W-band radiometer, a focal plane lens, an arc-shaped orbit for horizontal pixel, a plane reflector for vertical pixel, and a control computer. The radiometer is placed on a rotating base of the arc-shaped orbit. When the radiometer has a linear polarized antenna, rotating the base around the observation direction can obtain arbitrary linear polarization. By replacing with left-hand or right-land circularly polarized antenna, we can acquire the corresponding circular polarization image. Scanning imaging time is about 20s. The temperature sensitivity is better than 1K. The equivalent spatial resolution is about 1cm. Multi-polarization imaging experiments have been conducted and the polarization characteristics have been analyzed. The experimental results indicate that multi-polarization imaging can obtain more information of human body and concealed objects and is helpful to improve image quality.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717645","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61901242); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M660640,2020T130338); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717645","","Temperature sensors;Terahertz wave imaging;Polarization;Temperature;Sensitivity;Radiometry;Orbits","electromagnetic wave polarisation;focal planes;image resolution;lenses;radiometers;submillimetre wave antennas;submillimetre wave detectors;submillimetre wave imaging;terahertz wave detectors;terahertz wave imaging","W-band passive imaging system;W-band radiometer;arc-shaped orbit;linear polarized antenna;arbitrary linear polarization;circular polarization imaging;polarization characteristics;passive terahertz multipolarization imaging experiments;personnel screening application;terahertz wave imaging systems;security systems;large-scale commercial application;radiometer performance;single polarization;dual polarization;single frequency band data;radiometer hardware performance;multiple polarization imaging system;focal plane lens;leftt-hand circularly polarized antenna;right-hand circularly polarized antenna","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The magnetic flux linkage and the induced emf depend on the distance between the stages. This induced emf tries to circulate a current through the coils in the subsequent stages, if allowed to flow by such means of Pulsed Power Source (PPS) connection with the coils i.e., it depends on the winding direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise) of the coils and the connection of the crowbar diode in the PPS circuit. If crowbar diode is connected in parallel with the capacitor bank then the series main switch resists this induced flow of current through the coil, but if crowbar diode is connected in parallel with the coil in accordance to its winding direction then induced current flows through the coil. In this paper, the effect of this induced current on the motion of the projectile inside a multistage induction coilgun has been analyzed taking different lengths of the hollow projectile of fixed mass and outer diameter. The results of each case have then been compared with that of a single stage coilgun. Analyses have been made using the 2D transient solver of ANSOFT Maxwell software package with excitation (two 252 μF capacitors charged at 2 kV) given only for the first stage. Only two stages have been considered since farther stages will have negligible magnetic flux linkage with the first stage. For each projectile, distance between two stages has been varied starting from 2.8 cm to 14.8 cm with a linear step of 1 cm. The results show that projectile motion is slightly effected in multistage depending on the distance between stages and the length of the projectile. The results will be helpful for maintaining a suitable distance between stages in the multistage design of an induction coilgun.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717494","","Coils;Couplings;Magnetic flux;Coilguns;Software packages;Projectiles;Windings","capacitors;electromagnetic launchers;magnetic flux;projectiles;pulsed power supplies","mutual flux linkage;projectile motion;multistage induction coilgun;multistage operation;coil;subsequent stages;induced emf;Pulsed Power Source connection;winding direction;crowbar diode;series main switch resists this induced flow;current flows;single stage coilgun;farther stages;negligible magnetic flux linkage;multistage depending;voltage 2.0 kV;size 1.0 cm;size 2.8 cm to 14.8 cm","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, changes in the magnetic field structure will cause changes in the dynamic characteristics of the electrons in the source. We calculated the radial density of electrons in the Penning source, and the results showed that the addition of magnetic shielding is beneficial to reduce the fluctuation of electron density, thereby improving the uniformity of electron spatial distribution.

With emerging technologies at higher frequency bands such as terahertz and millimeter wave, such modeling capability will be in increasing demand. Full wave methods like method of moments (MoM) and multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM) remain useful tools to understand fundamental physical phenomena but quickly become intractable as the electrical size of the object increases. This is due to the prohibitive requirements of computational resources which are often inaccessible to many. Therefore, these methods are not suitable for realistic analysis and fast simulation of EM scattering from electrically large objects. On the contrary, hybrid high frequency methods trade some accuracy to enable efficient and effective simulation on affordable hardware. Collectively, physical optics (PO) method, shooting and bouncing rays (SBR), and physical theory of diffraction (PTD) approximately account for the EM scattering from the objects. The adoption of graphic processing unit (GPU) further enables fast generation of scattering data of various configurations, articulations, and obscuration.

Our results showed that normal cells are more sensitive to CAP treatment. Thus, under CAP treatment, we found a further decrease in normal cell survival respect to PAM treatment. Given that the main difference between CAP and PAM methods is in the physical factors used in CAP treatment, it is expected that normal cells have been more sensitized than cancer cells to physical factors, such as the electric field and UV radiation.

The microwave-excited atmospheric pressure plasma jet (ME-APPJ) provides high electron density and abundant active species[2]. For those reasons, the ME-APPJ is suitable for bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) decomposition as a plasma source. The BHET that basic component of PET is a monomer produced by depolymerizing the PET[3]. The boiling point of BHET is about 317 at 1 atm. Also, the gas temperature of ME-APPJ did not exceed 310 revealing that the results are not by the thermal decomposition. In this study, the reaction between ME-APPJ and BHET was analyzed by using optical emission spectroscopy, intensified charge coupled device and Fourier- transform infrared spectroscopy. The gas of double bonded CO and single bonded OH were produced from the BHET during reactions. The electron energy of ME-APPJ was estimated by comparing bonding energy of BHET with CO and OH which were experimentally produced. The electron energy of ME-APPJ is 347 – 467 kJ/mol. The concentration of CO gas was measured by reaction of BHET with ME-APPJ according to input power. In this study, CO gas was obtained from BHET decomposition through the ME-APPJ.

For monitoring signals containing the harmonics, the DDC is placed in close proximity of the powered electrode in an asymmetric, parallel plate RF discharge at 13.56 MHz, with 10–50 W (cw) power at 200 mTorr of argon gas pressure. The voltage signals obtained from the DDC data are a superposition of the fundamental and its harmonics that are produced by the plasma. These are separated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique carefully to avoid aliasing errors. A careful and complete analysis not only determines the harmonics present in plasma, but also yields accurately the power content in the forward and reflected waves of the fundamental along with other harmonics generated in the plasma. One can also estimate the complex plasma impedance, reflection coefficient, VSWR etc. at the plasma end which also makes it a valuable diagnostic tool3. In present experiment, the harmonic spectrum shows that the 3rd harmonic is the dominant harmonic, followed by the 2nd and 4th. Typically, one has for the 3rd harmonic ≈ 4.87 mW to 72.31 mW from 10 to 50 W of input RF power. Furthermore, using a simplified RF equivalent circuit model that includes the internal plasma source impedance Zg and the sheath impedance ($\mathrm{Z}_{\text{sh}}$), one can estimate the strength of lumped RF voltage source $\left\vert V_{rf}^{pl}\right\vert$ for all harmonics induced in RF discharge.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717673","","Radio frequency;Voltage measurement;Power system harmonics;Fault location;Harmonic analysis;Transmission line measurements;Discharges (electric)","argon;equivalent circuits;fast Fourier transforms;high-frequency discharges;plasma density;plasma sheaths;plasma sources","characterizing nonlinear harmonics;radiofrequency discharges;noninvasive diagnostic technique;parallel plate radio frequency;broadband dual directional coupler;voltage signals;asymmetric plate;fast Fourier transform technique;complex plasma impedance;plasma end;harmonic spectrum;input RF power;lumped RF voltage source;RF discharge;internal plasma source impedance","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This power flow is associated with a vastness of scales in time (discharge length versus electron cyclotron frequencies), space (transmission line lengths versus electron gyroradius), and velocity (outgassed neutrals versus the propagation speeds of the EM waves in each medium), as well as highly coupled multi-physics which make straightforward numerical approaches not viable.

Although the determinants of $k$ include the skin depth as a function of electron density and effective electron collision frequency, those plasma parameters can be calculated inversely from the relation between $k$ and electrical parameters at the antenna of ICP without additional diagnostic tools at a given pressure. In real-time non-invasive plasma diagnosis method using the determined $k$ based on the transformer model, the magnetic inductance due to the discharge current path ($L_{p}$) is assumed to be equal to the inductance of antenna ($L_{a}$) to simplify the circuit analysis model1. This study clarifies the applicable discharge condition of $L_{p}=L_{a}$ assumption in transformer model analysis by measuring voltage and current(V-I) of the antenna and plasma parameters. Difference between calculated values of $k$ from the measured antenna V-I and plasma properties in various conditions explains the possible range of $L_{p}=L_{a}$ assumption. Experiment was conducted on H-mode ICP discharge and the results are in good agreement with the predictive trends based on numerical approach of electromagnetic model.

The thyristors in this mode have subnanosecond switching time and unusually high dI/dt capability of more than $100\ \text{kA}/\mu\mathrm{s}$. Along with the high blocking voltage, high peak current and their affordable price nowadays, it has led to a growing interest in using off-the-shelf thyristors as fast switches for pulsed power applications. However, due to strict requirements for triggering pulse (a voltage rise rate of more than 1 kV/ns), a triggering generator becomes complicated, bulky and expensive to manufacture. Therefore, it is necessary to find a new design of the triggering generator. One of the possible solutions is using avalanche S-diodes2 recently appeared in the pulsed power domain. The S-diodes can operate in pulse-shaping circuits, easily producing subnanosecond pulses. The research is focused on the possibility of using the pulse generator based on the S-diodes for triggering thyristors in impact-ionization wave mode. An output part of the triggering generator consists of the avalanche S-diode, standard laser diode and high-gain PCSS. It produces pulses with a voltage amplitude of up to 3 kV with a voltage rise rate of about 1 kV/ns on a capacitive dummy load, which represents a thyristor. Different types of standard thyristors of rated voltage from 0.6 to 1.2 kV will be tested.

Key parameters historically difficult to measure in the understanding of Z-pinch dynamics are magnetic field and current distributions as a function as time and space. One of the reasons is that gas-puff Z-pinches display many different plasma conditions and instabilities over tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, hence characterizing the dynamics of the implosion requires a complex set of measurements. One way to mitigate instabilities is to apply an axial magnetic field. This may also decrease the temperature and density that the plasma might reach by limiting the compression. Consequently, characterizing the plasma conditions in accordance with an externally applied B-field is of paramount importance. The Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) in Israel developed different spectroscopic techniques to simultaneously measure $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}, \mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{e}}, \mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{z}}$ and $\mathrm{B}_{\theta}$ on Z-pinches. We present here experimental results from Oxygen gas-puff Z-pinch carried out at and in collaboration with WIS using a ~300 kA current driver with a $1.6\ \mu \mathrm{s}$ rise time. $\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{z}}$ and $\mathrm{B}_{\theta}$ measurements (“-’ 0.3 T to 4 T) were based on Zeeman splitting and polarization of visible emission lines while $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}(\sim 5\ \text{eV}$ to 15 eV) and $\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{e}}(\sim 10^{18}-10^{19}\mathrm{g}/\text{cm}^{3})$ were estimated with line ratio and line shape analysis, respectively, using the atomic physics code CRETIN. For each shot, all measurements were time gated and spatially resolved allowing a full characterization of the O gas-puff implosion. Such data allowed interesting comparisons with MHD code TRAC-II that showed good agreement with the experiment. This work also aims to compare Z-pinch dynamics for different drivers. The data collected at WIS will be eventually compared to similar measurements performed at UCSD on a linear transformer driver (~800 kA and 160 ns rise). As a first look, we also present here some gas-puff Z-pinch temperature measurements made at UCSD showing how the plasma conditions differ from the ones at WIS.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717617","","Temperature measurement;Atomic measurements;Magnetic field measurement;Codes;Plasma measurements;Transformers;Time measurement","explosions;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma inertial confinement;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma shock waves;plasma simulation;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes;plasma X-ray sources;Z pinch;Zeeman effect","visible emission lines;line shape analysis;Z-pinch dynamics;gas-puff Z-pinch temperature measurements;gas-puff Z-pinch parameters;visible spectroscopy;alternate fusion schemes;intense X-ray sources;current distributions;gas-puff Z-pinches;plasma conditions;axial magnetic field;externally applied B-field;spectroscopic techniques;Oxygen gas-puff Z-pinch;~300 kA current driver;rise time;gas-puff implosion;current 300.0 kA;time 1.6 mus;time 160.0 ns;electron volt energy 5.0 eV to 15.0 eV","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Presented will be measurements that brought up that at plasma stagnations a large fraction of the plasma kinetic energy can be stored in hydrodynamic motion rather than in thermal motion, while only the ion thermal motion is responsible for the fusion rates and the electron heating. In addition, a novel method recently developed for the determination of the ion temperature, and thus for discriminating it from the hydromotion will be presented, together with the determination of the hydromotion dissipation time. This is unlike Doppler broadening or neutron Time-of-Flight methods in fusion plasmas that yield the ion total kinetic energy. The measurement implications on investigating the plasma turbulence at stagnation will be presented. A key parameter in the determination of the plasma flow and development of instabilities in pulsed-power systems is the current flow in the systems. Generally, in HED plasmas, the Zeeman splitting is obscured by the Stark and Doppler effects. Reviewed will be measurements of the magnetic fields that overcome this problem in ion diodes, plasma opening switches, electron diodes, Z-pinches, and magnetized plasma compression. Discussed will be unanticipated magnetic-field profiles, such as the relatively unimportant role of the magnetic field pressure in the pressure balance in stagnating Z-pinch plasmas, together with observations of unexpected time-dependent behavior of the current distribution. Effects of the current distribution observed on the plasma flows and plasma rotation will be demonstrated, for both the magnetized and unmagnetized plasma compression. Such observations have significant implications on the established concepts of implosion dynamics and provide challenges for model and code validation. Discussed will be possibilities to employ the spectroscopic methods developed in large plasma implosion experiments utilizing intense current pulses or intense radiation.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717697","","Temperature measurement;Magnetic field measurement;Ions;Plasma measurements;Current distribution;Plasmas;Magnetic fields","Doppler broadening;explosions;plasma density;plasma diagnostics;plasma diodes;plasma flow;plasma instability;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma switches;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes;plasma turbulence;pulsed power technology;Stark effect;Z pinch","ion temperature;current flow;pulsed power systems;high-energy-density plasmas;plasma stagnations;plasma kinetic energy;hydrodynamic motion;ion thermal motion;hydromotion dissipation time;neutron time-of-flight methods;fusion plasmas;ion total kinetic energy;plasma turbulence;plasma flow;HED plasmas;ion diodes;plasma opening switches;magnetized plasma compression;magnetic field pressure;Z-pinch plasmas;current distribution;plasma rotation;unmagnetized plasma compression;spectroscopic methods;plasma implosion experiments;current pulses;electron heating;Doppler broadening;Zeeman splitting;plasma instabilities;Stark effects;pressure balance;magnetized plasma compression;implosion dynamics","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The electricity is supplied to the electric railway while moving, because the contact wire and the contact strip are come into contact. At that time, the arc discharge occurs after the contact wire and the contact strip are separated because of poor contacting. The contact wire is damaged because fusion and evaporation is repeated by continuation of arc discharge. The generation of metal vapor is a factor of continuation of arc discharge. The metal vapor occurs when the temperature of the contact wire reaches the melting point. The electron density in arc increased with increasing the Cu vapor mixing rate in arc because ionization voltage of copper is lower than that of gas. Thus, the breakdown voltage decreases and the arc becomes easy to be maintained more. From the above, the contact wire disconnects in the worst case. It is necessary to figure out the damage mechanism for stable supply of electricity and long-life and low cost of facility. Some researchers have researched that the mass in molten area has been analyzed from damege of the contact wire at their experiment. However, the contact wire melted by arc discharge is changed in $1 \mu \mathrm{s}$ order. Therefore, the elucidation of physical phenomenon using numerical analysis is required. In this paper, the three dimensional electromagnetic thermal fluid simulation is developed to calculate metal vapor which is generated from electrodes heated by arc. As a result, the metal vapor was calculate from anode. The program under consideration of metal vapor conservation equation was created for calculation metal vapor.

Calculated results show very good agreement with the Laplace method3 when dealing with a uniform structure, while our new method is advantageous for the more practical non-uniform open-cavity structures. The applicability of the zero-field and the outgoing-wave boundary conditions at the collector end is discussed. These two boundary conditions agree well when the beam-wave resonant line and the waveguide dispersion curve intercept at the backward-wave region but differ significantly at the forward-wave region. In addition, the TM-mode beam-wave coupling strength is found to be strongly correlated with the starting current, which can be utilized to avoid the potential competition from the TE modes. The starting current of the TM11 gyrotron remains low in the case with low-beam voltage, indicating an additional operating condition that may facilitate the development of low-cost and tabletop gyrotron systems. The beam-voltage and magnetic-field tunings are investigated for an open-cavity structure with the numerical method. Interestingly, the TM11 gyrotron as well as the TE01 gyrotron exhibit a similar starting behavior, which warrants the potential applications of the TM-mode gyrotrons.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717822","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2112-M-007-015-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717822","","Couplings;Electric potential;Conferences;Gyrotrons;Magnetic resonance;Voltage;Boundary conditions","gyrotrons;numerical analysis","starting current;TM11 gyrotron;operating condition;tabletop gyrotron systems;numerical method;TE01 gyrotron;TM-mode gyrotrons;start-oscillation behaviors;Laplace method;nonuniform open-cavity structures;outgoing-wave boundary conditions;beam-wave resonant line;backward-wave region;forward-wave region;TM-mode beam-wave coupling strength;magnetic-field tunings;low-beam voltage;waveguide dispersion curve intercept;zero-field","","","","3","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An array of optical fibers aligned across the pinch axis coupled to a high-resolution spectrometer allowed for determination of the azimuthal magnetic field at the edge of the plasma. Emission from a laser produced Al plasma was detected by a separate optical spectrometer and used to measure the axial magnetic field strength close to the central axis. Axial magnetic fields with values ranging from 0.29–2.39 T were measured between 230 and 94 ns prior to stagnation. One-dimensional MHD simulations (TRAC-II) of the gas-puff implosions show good agreement with the experimental data.

Furthermore, the air-breathing Hall-effect thruster (ABHET) has additional benefits in comparison to the HET. By using the ambient air as a propellant while the HET uses the noble gas as a propellant, it doesn't require a space to store a propellant, which results the decrease in its size. It may allow the spacecraft to bring more payloads and to be able to be operated for longer time. Previously, the research1 on the ABHET has been performed, but the power was so high that the thruster can't bear with it. This is because the research was done with the consideration that all atoms are fully ionized, which resulted very high power. Thus, this research is done in order to look at the proper ionization rate for which the device can bear with. The power needs to be reduced to approximately 1kW or less. The operational altitude is from 90km to 100km, which is known as the LEO (Low Earth Orbit). The power needed is calculated by controlling the ionization rate. Also, the length of the channel is considered to control the power. Based on the results, the proper ionization rate and the proper length of the channel are presented and discussed.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717959","","Space vehicles;Attitude control;Conferences;Ionization;Low earth orbit satellites;Propulsion;Plasmas","electric propulsion;ion engines;plasma devices;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;propellants;space vehicles","ABHET;ionization rate;air-breathing Hall-effect thruster;electric propulsion system;noble gas propellant;LEO;low earth orbit;distance 90.0 km to 100.0 km","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, THz waves also suffer from high sensitivity to adverse weather conditions when propagating in the near-surface atmosphere. There have been several systematic studies conducted on this under different weather conditions such as rain, fog, haze, cloud and air turbulence. In particular, several investigations of the scattering performance of terahertz waves in snow have been reported [1]. But, there is still a lack of systematic studies because of the difficulties in measurements and characterizations due to the complicate shapes of snow particles. Therefore, a combined approach relying on both theoretical models and case studies is valuable. In this work, we combine meteorological data and Mie scattering theory to investigate the scattering behavior of THz waves in falling snow and in a snow layer. The theoretical results are in rough qualitative agreement with the experimental data when gaseous attenuation and scintillation effect are not considered. Compared with the attenuation by rain, the THz signal suffers higher loss when propagates in dry and wet snow for frequencies above 200 GHz. Signal loss in dry snow layer is mainly attributed to scattering effects because of the low water content, and it doesn't change when the temperature is reduced from 0 to -20 oC. The absorption effect becomes more serious when snow wetness increases, but the scattering effect is largely unaffected by water content.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717532","","Wireless communication;Rain;Systematics;Sensitivity;Shape;Snow;Shape measurement","fog;hydrological techniques;Mie scattering;snow;terahertz wave absorption;wetting","terahertz waves;rain;wireless communications;THz waves;adverse weather conditions;near-surface atmosphere;cloud;air turbulence;scattering performance;snow particles;Mie scattering theory;scattering behavior;falling snow;gaseous attenuation;THz signal;wet snow;dry snow layer;scattering effect;snow wetness;meteorological data;frequency 200.0 GHz","","1","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In some microwave components commonly-used in spacecrafts, such as isolators and circulators, a typical parallel-dielectric-plate structure exists. Actually, the resonant multipacror is more likely to occur in this structure due to the local high electric field intensity resulted from the tiny space between two dielectric surfaces. For this type of the two-sided resonant multipactor, the most prominent feature is that the transit time of the electron should be an odd number of half cycles of the microwave electric field. It has been noted that up to date few publication focuses on the resonant multipactor as well as the parallel-dielectric-plate structure.

In this work, based on particle-in-cell simulations we studied the similarity of the radio-frequency (RF) discharges in geometrically similar gaps. The scaling relations of the electron density, electron heating, and electron impact ionization rate are confirmed with a dimension scaling factor varying from 1 to 10. The invariance of electron energy probability functions in similar discharges is confirmed in time and space. The results indicate that the similarity characteristics of RF discharges still exist in nonlocal discharge regimes, even though the traditional similarity relations based on the local kinetic approximations do not apply.

However, characterization studies on present state-of-the-art devices1, under high temperature conditions are not complete. In this work, Gated field emission arrays (GFEAs), fabricated using a novel method2, are a strong candidate as an electron source for vertical NVCTs. These devices have been characterized at high temperature (400º C). Experiments were carried out on $1000\times 1000$ arrays of GFEAs1 in a high vacuum chamber, using an in-house developed test jig consisting of a stainless-steel collector along with a tungsten probe pin to connect to the gate pad. A Molybdenum heater chuck for high temperature test was also developed. A fixed 100 V DC and 0–40 V DC sweep voltage were applied to collector and gate, respectively. I-V curves show that for gate voltage of 40 V, the collector current was $\approxeq 80\mu \mathrm{A}$ where a large gate leakage current of $\approx 6\ \text{mA}$ was observed. This low collector and large gate current are partially because of the large collector to array gap $(> 2\ \text{mm})$; however, the low emission current and high gate current are also the result of gas adsorbates. To study the performance, the GFEAs were baked at $400^{\circ}\ \mathrm{C}$, and in-situ I-V characterizations were carried out over a range of temperatures. It was found that at $400^{\circ}\ \mathrm{C}$, the collector current increased by $> 10\mathrm{x}$ while the gate leakage current decreased by $> 10\mathrm{x}$, and even after cooling down to room temperature, this result remained unchanged. The F-N plots comparing the collector current, before and after bake out, show the improvement. This improvement can be attributed to the desorption of water vapor during bakeout. To confirm this phenomenon, the GFEA die were taken out of the vacuum chamber, kept in room air for $4\sim 5$ days, and then tested again. After each test cycle, the high gate current and low emission current returned until being baked again.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717542","","Temperature distribution;Tungsten;Voltage;Logic gates;Plasmas;Pins;Leakage currents","electron field emission;elemental semiconductors;field emitter arrays;leakage currents;silicon","vacuum channel transistors;gated silicon field emitter arrays;gated field emission arrays;high vacuum chamber;in-house developed test jig;stainless-steel collector;tungsten probe pin;collector current;gate leakage current;low emission current;gate current;GFEA die;vertical NVCT;molybdenum heater chuck;temperature 400.0 degC;voltage 100.0 V;voltage 0.0 V to 40.0 V","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation conditions were set as gap width $d$ = 2mm, voltage amplitude $u$ = 0.5kV, frequency $f$ = 40kHz, and pressure $p$ = 0.1 kPa. The results showed that the average electron density and electron temperature over the gap were consistent with the trends of discharge current and gap voltage, respectively. At the time of the discharge peak, the electron density appeared a maximum near the instantaneous anode, the ion density was 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the electron density, and the electric field intensity increased approximately linearly from the instantaneous anode to the instantaneous cathode, which is characteristic of Townsend discharge. Neutral particle density (CO, O, C and O2) had two peaks near the two electrodes, and its overall density in the gap showed a stepwise increase trend, which has a significant cumulative effect. The density of CO was basically equal to that of O, and much higher than that of C and O2. The density of vibrational excited CO2 increased sharply when the discharge occurred, and it gradually decreased after the discharge was extinguished, eventually reaching a balance of production and consumption. The results can provide guidance for further understanding of the CO2 discharge mechanism and its conversion.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717497","","Plasma simulation;Conferences;Voltage;Production;Market research;Ions;Discharges (electric)","carbon compounds;dielectric-barrier discharges;electron density;plasma density;plasma simulation;plasma temperature;plasma transport processes;Townsend discharge","discharge peak;instantaneous anode;ion density;Townsend discharge;neutral particle density;discharge characteristics;particle distribution;simulation conditions;average electron density;electron temperature;discharge current;CO2 DBD;CO2 dielectric barrier discharge plasma simulation model;CO2 discharge mechanism","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Terahertz bands, which have many advantages of large bandwidth, high penetration etc., are attractive in high-speed satellite data link, ultrashort-range interface of portable device, and wireless local area networks (WLANs)1. However, full-duplexer terahertz communication technology has rarely been reported, due to the lack of high-performance terahertz duplexers. To solve this problem, we propose a compact G-band diplexer based on quasi-elliptical filter. Through by-pass coupling, each filter generates a transmission zero in stop bands, which greatly improves the isolation between the two channels, reduces the guard band width, and improves the spectrum utilization. Two quasi-elliptic filters are connected by a T-junction to form the proposed diplexer. By using common junction as a part of filters, the optimization parameters are reduced and the simulation efficiency is greatly improved. Simulation results show that the proposed diplexer has a return loss greater than 15dB in channel 1(200-208GHz) and channel 2 (212-220GHz), and the isolation between the two channels is better than 50dB. This compact, high-isolation diplexer has great potential in G-band terahertz communication systems.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717806","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFF0109702); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91738102,61771116); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717806","","Wireless communication;Military communication;Wireless LAN;Satellites;Simulation;Full-duplex system;Plasmas","band-pass filters;band-stop filters;elliptic filters;multiplexing equipment;optimisation","high-performance terahertz duplexers;quasielliptical filter;stop bands;guard band width;quasielliptic filters;high-isolation diplexer;G-band terahertz communication systems;military consumer electronics applications;high-data-rate wireless communications;terahertz bands;high-speed satellite data;ultrashort-range interface;wireless local area networks;full-duplexer terahertz communication technology;compact G-band diplexer;frequency 212.0 GHz to 220.0 GHz;frequency 200.0 GHz to 208.0 GHz","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is also well-known that the derivation of the Vlasov equation from the plasma kinetic equation can be done by hypothetically breaking the charged particles into many smaller pieces, again while maintaining the charge-to-mass ratio, which will remove the discrete-particle nature of the plasma and allow the definition of smooth distribution function [1]. As the number of pieces tends to infinity, we find that this pulverization limit yields the Vlasov equation, or the “collisionless” Boltzmann equation. As PIC is typically considered to be approximating the Vlasov equation, it seems that these two constructs, namely pulverization and macroparticles, might be in some kind of conflict.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717706","","Costs;Codes;Boltzmann equation;Conferences;Mathematical models;Plasmas;Kinetic theory","Boltzmann equation;plasma kinetic theory;plasma simulation;plasma transport processes;Vlasov equation","PIC codes;particle-in-cell method;particle distribution;particle noise;Vlasov equation;plasma kinetic equation;charged particles;charge-to-mass ratio;discrete-particle nature;smooth distribution function;collisionless Boltzmann equation","","","","2","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this process requires extreme reaction conditions with high temperatures to obtain reasonable yield of value-added chemicals, which leads to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface and therefore the deactivation of the catalyst. Non-thermal plasma has been investigated as an alternative method to the conventional chemical and/or catalytic processes. Among different non-thermal plasma techniques, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) could be a suitable source for the plasma processes for CO2 conversion, due to due to its simple design and up-scaling capability and its successful experience in ozone generation and gas cleaning on an industrial scale. In addition, catalysts can be easily integrated into a DBD reactor to generate a synergistic effect of plasma-catalysis, improving the selectivity of the desired products. In this work, plasma-catalytic CO2 reforming of CH4 over different catalysts has been investigated in a coaxial DBD reactor at ambient conditions. The effect of the catalysts on the plasma reforming process is evaluated in terms of the conversion of CO2 and CH4, the yield and selectivity of different products, the carbon deposition on the spent catalysts as well as the stability of catalyst during a long-time reaction.

Due to the importance of multicomponent transport, Kim and Lee reported that gas velocity and temperature distributions affect the spatial distributions of neutral radicals and even electrons and ions [1]. Since the high temperature of the electrode causes depletion of background gas due to the ideal gas law, ion energy and angle distributions (IEADs) are changed due to the reduced collisions of ions with neutrals. In a recent semiconductor industry, it is required to achieve the extreme uniformity of the spatial distributions of not only the ion energy but also the angle distributions. Thus, we investigated the effects of electrode temperature on plasma parameters, especially IEAD, in intermediate pressure capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs) using two-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision method. It was found that plasma density decreased, while sheath size increased with the higher temperature of the electrode. It was also found that ion energy increased, and angle became narrower due to fewer collision. The spatial variation of IEADs was also affected by the change of the electrode temperature. As a case study for PECVD, SiH4/He capacitively coupled plasma was selected to deposit a hydrogenated amorphous silicon film. In this deposition simulation, a fluid model was used. It was found that a sufficient increase of the electrode temperature was best for obtaining a uniform deposition rate profile in the test bed.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717666","","Electrodes;Temperature distribution;Graphical models;Fluids;Electronics industry;Ions;Plasmas","amorphous semiconductors;chemical vapour deposition;elemental semiconductors;high-frequency discharges;hydrogen;Monte Carlo methods;plasma collision processes;plasma CVD;plasma density;plasma materials processing;plasma sheaths;plasma simulation;semiconductor growth;semiconductor thin films;silicon;silicon compounds","electrode temperature;spatial distributions;plasma parameters;intermediate pressure capacitively coupled plasmas;nonisothermal wall conditions;plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition;gas velocity;temperature distributions;background gas;ideal gas law;ion energy;angle distributions;IEAD;plasma density;spatial variation;capacitively coupled plasma","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, myelinated nerve structure is experimentally and theoretically studied using synchrotron-radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy. We experimentally demonstrated the high contrast of mid-infrared reflectivity/refractivity between the myelin sheath and other structures in nervous tissue [1]. It is found that, with a certain mid-infrared to terahertz spectral range, the myelin sheath possesses $\mathrm{a}\approx 2$ - fold higher refraction index compared to the outer medium or the inner axon, suggesting that myelin can serve as an infrared dielectric waveguide. By calculating the correlation between the material characteristics of myelin and the radical energy distribution in myelinated nerves, it is demonstrated that the sheath, with a normal thickness $(\approx 2\mu \mathrm{m})$ and dielectric constant in nature, can confine the infrared field energy within the sheath and enable the propagation of an infrared signal at the millimeter scale without dramatic energy loss. The infrared and THz energy concentration in myelin mainly depends on the myelin thickness, the difference of dielectric constant between the myelin and axon fluid, rather than the absolute values of the inner radius and inner dielectric constant of axon. The energy of signal propagation is supplied and amplified when crossing the nodes of Ranvier via periodic relay. These findings provide the first model for explaining the mechanism of infrared and terahertz neurotransmission through myelinated nerves, which may promote the development of biological-tissue label-free detection, biomaterial-based sensors, neural information, and noninvasive brain-machine interfaces.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717635","","Axons;Energy loss;Dielectric constant;Neurotransmitters;Fluids;Correlation;Myelin","bioelectric phenomena;biological tissues;biomedical optical imaging;dielectric waveguides;Fourier transform infrared spectra;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;permittivity;refractive index;synchrotron radiation","signal propagation;infrared neurotransmission;terahertz neurotransmission;myelin sheath;myelinated nerve structure;synchrotron-radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy;infrared dielectric waveguide;myelin thickness;midinfrared reflectivity-refractivity;refraction index;radical energy distribution;dielectric constant;biological-tissue label-free detection;biomaterial-based sensors;neural information;brain-machine interfaces","","","","1","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Gamble III will continue with the use of water for the intermediate store (IS) capacitors and the pulse forming line (PFL) output. However, to increase reliability, we aim to improve both the IS (between IS and PFL) switch and PFL output switch.

Simulation results show that specific stopbands will emerge at all of the intersections between the dispersion curves of different TM0n, modes when considering infinite-length structures with corrugations. The number of split coupled harmonics with finite length will be increased. The dispersion relations of finite length structures are thus regrouped according to the stopbands and become the same shape as that of the infinite structure which is derived analytically.

On the other hand, models of interstellar dust grain growth assume that dust grains are spherical and not elongated. We show that when dusty plasma effects and the dipole moment of water molecules are together taken into account, it is concluded that ice grains in interstellar space should be prolate ellipsoids and not spheres. Dusty plasma analysis shows that an ice grain is charged to a negative potential that has magnitude nearly equal to the electron temperature. Several different mechanisms causing deviation from sphericity are identified; these mechanisms involve the interaction of the dipole moment of water molecules with electric fields associated with ice grain charging. These mechanisms include focusing of water molecule trajectories, migration of water molecules in a quasi-liquid layer on the grain surface towards regions where the electric field is strongest, enhancement of this migration by bombardment of energetic protons that gain energy upon falling into the ice grain negative potential, and mutual repulsion by electric charges having the same sign. The aspect ratio is established shortly after the ice grain is formed and then is maintained as the grain grows.","2576-7208","978-1-7281-5307-0","10.1109/ICOPS37625.2020.9717577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717577","","Protons;Electric potential;Focusing;Surface charging;Ice;Dusty plasmas;Plasmas","astrochemistry;cosmic dust;dusty plasmas;elongation;grain growth;ice;interstellar matter;water","water molecules;grain surface;mutual repulsion;ice grain;interstellar ice dust grains;interstellar dust alignment;interstellar dust grain growth;dipole moment;interstellar space;water molecule trajectories","","","","0","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, it is critical to design and optimize the liquid cooling in induction motor to produce required torque and power for electric vehicles.

To meet these challenges, conventional stator manufacturing methods are increasingly being replaced by novel production technologies such as the hairpin technology and the flatpack method. These technologies do achieve comparatively high mechanical copper fill factors and thus better stator performance. The flatpack method represents a bending process of a flat, comb-like assembly of numerous electrical steel lamellas with assembled prebent copper windings, providing similar copper fill ratios as the hairpin technology. In contrast to hairpin technology, however, flatpack bending does not require extensive welding operations of electrical conductors, which cause decreased robustness in mass production. Instead, the roundness of the bent inner stator geometry depends on the ability of adapting process parameters to the workpiece properties. Roundness deviations do influence possible air gaps between stator and rotor, and thus show significant impact on the performance of the electric machine. For this reason, an advanced finite element model was developed, allowing the multiple flatpack bending steps and the subsequent joining operation to be simulated as accurately as possible. The forming simulation results in a circular stator geometry with roundness deviations that depend on workpiece properties and process parameters. For validating the finite element model, three real flatpacks were bent, its ends were welded together as a ring and subsequently measured with a coordinate measurement machine. Furthermore, the numerical model was used to quantify sensitivities of bending parameters on the resulting roundness of the stator.

In particular, the process of taping the wire harness on the assembly boards with conventional adhesive tape is a very time-consuming manual work step. In order to automate this, various methods have already been tested and one of the most promising is the dosing process. Thereby a nozzle moves along the routed cables and covers them with silicone rubber. In order to apply this process successfully in practice, it is particularly necessary to sheat variable wire harness geometries that differ in terms of their diameter and composition. In scope of this work, a nozzle was developed, which can be infinitely adjusted to different cable strands using an iris diaphragm mechanism. The fused deposition modelling (FDM) process was used for fast production and testing of various nozzle construction. In addition to various cable harnesses, concepts were developed and validated in order to cover nodes or branch points with the dosing process. All experiments were carried out in the form of model tests in terms of their applicability in practice.","","978-1-7281-8458-6","10.1109/EDPC51184.2020.9718554","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718554","wiring harness;taping;dosing process;automotive industry;wiring harness production;silicone rubber;automation","Wiring;Geometry;Service robots;Wires;Production;Manuals;Frequency division multiplexing","","","","","","16","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the magnet temperature affects torque, maximum speed, power losses and the mechanical stability of the motor. These parameters can be adapted by adjusting the magnet geometry and the air gap, reducing the influence of eddy currents.

We compare the relative expressivity of these logics and other related logics, including a logic of false beliefs from the literature. The four main logics are all less expressive than the standard modal logic over various model classes, and the logics of sane and insane beliefs are, respectively, equally expressive as the logics of unreliable and reliable beliefs on any class of models. The logics of reliable and unreliable beliefs are then combined into a bimodal logic, which turns out to be equally expressive as the standard modal logic. Despite this, we cannot obtain a complete axiomatization of the minimal bimodal logic, by simply translating the axioms and rules of the minimal modal logic $\textbf{K}$ into the bimodal language. We then introduce a schematic modality which unifies reliable and unreliable beliefs and axiomatize it over the class of all frames and also the class of serial frames.

Paradoxes can be used in proofs of some other theorems—thus Liar’s paradox has been used in the classical proof of Tarski’s theorem on the undefinability of truth in sufficiently rich languages. This paradox (as well as Richard’s paradox) appears implicitly in Gödel’s proof of his celebrated first incompleteness theorem.

The problem of finding a complete and natural axiomatization for this logic in the original tri-modal language has been open for more than one decade. In this paper, we give a natural axiomatization of $\textsf{DTL}$ and prove its strong completeness with respect to the class of all dynamic topological systems. Our proof system is infinitary in the sense that it contains an infinitary derivation rule with countably many premises and one conclusion.

This resampling technique is used to mitigate noise in imbalanced datasets at three levels, i.e. first clusters datasets using K-Means clustering technique, SMOTE inside clusters for handling imbalance by inducing synthetic instances of class in minority and lastly, using ENN technique to remove instances that create noise afterwards. Experiments were performed using 11 binary imbalanced datasets by varying attribute noise percentages, and by using area under receiver operating curve as performance metrics.

In ABC, exploration is good because each bee moves toward random neighbors in the first and second phases. In ABC, exploitation is poor because it does not try to examine a promising region of search space carefully to see if it contains a good local minimum. In this study, ICA is considered to improve ABC exploitation, and two novel swarm-based hybrid methods called ABC–ICA and ABC–ICA1 are proposed, which combine the characteristics of ABC and ICA. The proposed methods improve the evaluations results in both continuous and discrete environments compared to the baseline methods. The second method improves the first optimization method as well. Feature selection can be considered to be an optimization problem because selecting the appropriate feature subset is very important and the action of appropriate feature selection has a great influence on the efficiency of classifier algorithms in supervised methods. Therefore, to focus on feature selection is a key issue and is very important. In this study, different discrete versions of the proposed methods have been introduced that can be used in feature selection and feature scoring problems, which have been successful in evaluations. In this study, a problem called cold start is introduced, and a solution is presented that has a great impact on the efficiency of the proposed methods in feature scoring problem. A total of 16 UCI data sets and 2 Amazon data sets have been used for the evaluation of the proposed methods in feature selection problem. The parameters that have been compared are classification accuracy and the number of features required for classification.

Here, a new feature-based optical flow along with BF algorithm is utilized to compute the affine matrix of a regional center on SIFT key points in frames. Experimental results depict that the proposed approach is more efficient and more robust in comparison with the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with more complex scenarios.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716900","visual tracking;SIFT;optical flow;subspace learning;belief propagation","","","","","1","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, we propose a topic coherence-based cross-domain recommender model. The core concept is to use topic modeling to extract topics from user-generated content such as reviews and combine them with reliable semantic coherence techniques to link different domains, using Wikipedia as a reference corpus. We experiment with different topic coherence methods such as pointwise mutual information (PMI) and explicit semantic analysis (ESA). Experimental results presented demonstrate that our approach, using PMI as topic coherence, yields 22.6% and using ESA yields 54.4% higher precision as compared with cross-domain recommender system based on semantic clustering.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716903","recommender systems;topic modeling;pointwise mutual information;explicit semantic analysis;topic coherence","","","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The β and γ waves of the EEG signal are used to extract the features that represent the evoked activity in each group of frames using the Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) technique. Significant EEG patterns are derived from the time-correlated measurements, which can be related to the subjects’ interests. In addition, the conjunctions that represent the occurrence of segments-of-interest in more than one channel are determined. The results show that ~15% of the segments attracted the attention of the viewers in each test video clip.

It is primarily attributed due to unplanned urbanization, population explosion and globalization. Out of these, dengue is considered the most important arboviral disease because of its predominant growth in the past. The presented study explores the immense potential of Internet of things (IoT), fog and cloud computing for providing technology-based healthcare solutions for dengue virus (DENV) infection. In this paper, a hierarchical healthcare computing system for controlling DENV infection using fog–cloud-assisted IoT is proposed. This system provides a real-time remote diagnosis of DENV infection in individuals and monitors and predicts their health sensitivity during its infection period. The system uses fog computing to diagnose the DENV infection status of the individuals using $k$-means clustering and generates immediate diagnostic alerts to individuals, at the fog layer. Furthermore, the system uses cloud computing to monitor and predict the probabilistic health sensitivity of the DENV-infected individuals using Bayesian belief network and artificial neural network, respectively, at the cloud layer. The prediction of health sensitivity in the proposed system helps the infected individuals and healthcare agencies in determining the health vulnerability of DENV-infected individuals and preventing severe or permanent health losses in the future. The proposed system is experimentally evaluated using well-defined approaches, which conform to its validity and applicability. The results obtained from the experimental evaluations of the proposed system acknowledge the performance superiority and high efficiency of the system in delivering DENV-related healthcare services in real time.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxaa005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716902","arboviral diseases;Internet of things (IoT);fog computing;vector-borne disease;cloud computing;artificial neural network (ANN);k-means clustering (KMC);Bayesian belief network (BBN);global positioning system (GPS)","","","","","1","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We also provide an explicit sufficient stability criterion to ascertain when a more general Gaussian probability distribution has the same asymptotic nodal distribution law.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717118","","","","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For the $1$-point and $2$-point correlation function, we obtain several characterizations in terms of Painlevé transcendents, both at finite $N$ and asymptotically as $N \to \infty $. In the asymptotic analysis, two regimes of interest are distinguished: boundary asymptotics where parameters of the correlation function can touch the boundary of the limiting eigenvalue support and bulk asymptotics where they are strictly inside the support. For the complex Ginibre ensemble this involves Painlevé IV at the boundary as $N \to \infty $. Our approach, together with the results in [49], suggests that this should arise in a much broader class of planar models. For the bulk asymptotics, one of our results can be interpreted as the merging of two “planar Fisher–Hartwig singularities” where Painlevé V arises in the asymptotics. We also discuss the correspondence of our results with a normal matrix model with $d$-fold rotational symmetries known as the lemniscate ensemble, recently studied in [15, 18]. Our approach is flexible enough to apply to non-Gaussian models such as the truncated unitary ensemble or induced Ginibre ensemble; we show that in the former case Painlevé VI arises at finite $N$. Scaling near the boundary leads to Painlevé V, in contrast to the Ginibre ensemble.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717157","","","","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, we find the optimal constant $c = c_{\theta }$ such that $u,v$ can be dilated to a pair of operators $c U, c V$, where $U$ and $V$ are commuting unitaries. We show that $$\begin{equation*} c_{\theta} = \frac{4}{\|u_{\theta}+u_{\theta}^*+v_{\theta}+v_{\theta}^*\|}, \end{equation*}$$ where $u_{\theta }, v_{\theta }$ are the universal $q$-commuting pair of unitaries, and we give numerical estimates for the above quantity. In the course of our proof, we also consider dilating $q$-commuting unitaries to scalar multiples of $q^{\prime}$-commuting unitaries. The techniques that we develop allow us to give new and simple “dilation theoretic” proofs of well-known results regarding the continuity of the field of rotations algebras. In particular, for the so-called “almost Mathieu operator” $h_{\theta } = u_{\theta }+u_{\theta }^*+v_{\theta }+v_{\theta }^*$, we recover the fact that the norm $\|h_{\theta }\|$ is a Lipschitz continuous function of $\theta $, as well as the result that the spectrum $\sigma (h_{\theta })$ is a $\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuous function in $\theta $ with respect to the Hausdorff metric. In fact, we obtain this Hölder continuity of the spectrum for every self-adjoint *-polynomial $p(u_{\theta },v_{\theta })$, which in turn endows the rotation algebras with the natural structure of a continuous field of C*-algebras.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717147","","","","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The singularity set of a noncommutative polynomial $f=f(x_1,\dots ,x_g)$ is $\mathscr{Z}(\,f)=(\mathscr{Z}_n(\,f))_n$, where $\mathscr{Z}_n(\,f)=\{X \in{\operatorname{M}}_{n}({\mathbb{C}})^g \colon \det f(X) = 0\}.$ The 1st main theorem of this article shows that the irreducible factors of $f$ are in a natural bijective correspondence with irreducible components of $\mathscr{Z}_n(\,f)$ for every sufficiently large $n$. With each polynomial $h$ in $x$ and $x^*$ one also associates its real singularity set $\mathscr{Z}^{{\operatorname{re}}}(h)=\{X\colon \det h(X,X^*)=0\}$. A polynomial $f$ that depends on $x$ alone (no $x^*$ variables) will be called analytic. The main Nullstellensatz proved here is as follows: for analytic $f$ but for $h$ dependent on possibly both $x$ and $x^*$, the containment $\mathscr{Z}(\,f) \subseteq \mathscr{Z}^{{\operatorname{re}}} (h)$ is equivalent to each factor of $f$ being “stably associated” to a factor of $h$ or of $h^*$. For perspective, classical Hilbert-type Nullstellensätze typically apply only to analytic polynomials $f,h $, while real Nullstellensätze typically require adjusting the functions by sums of squares of polynomials (sos). Since the above “algebraic certificate” does not involve a sos, it seems justified to think of this as the natural determinantal Hilbert Nullstellensatz. An earlier paper of the authors (Adv. Math. 331 (2018): 589–626) obtained such a theorem for special classes of analytic polynomials $f$ and $h$. This paper requires few hypotheses and hopefully brings this type of Nullstellensatz to near final form. Finally, the paper gives a Nullstellensatz for zeros ${\mathcal{V}}(\,f)=\{X\colon f(X,X^*)=0\}$ of a hermitian polynomial $f$, leading to a strong Positivstellensatz for quadratic free semialgebraic sets by the use of a slack variable.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717106","","","","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Specifically, if $\Omega \subset{\mathbb{R}}^d$ is a bounded convex domain and $u$ is the solution of $-\Delta u =1$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, then $$\begin{equation*} \|\nabla u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} < d\frac{|\Omega|}{|\partial\Omega|}\,. \end{equation*}$$ Moreover, both inequalities are sharp in the sense that if the constant $d$ is replaced by something smaller there exist convex domains for which the inequalities fail.

In particular, in the case of the general linear group, it provides a geometric interpretation of the Robinson–Schensted correspondence between permutations and pairs of standard tableaux of the same shape. We extend Steinberg’s approach to the case of a symmetric pair $(G, K)$ to obtain two different maps, namely a generalized Steinberg map and an exotic moment map. Although the framework is general, in this paper we focus on the pair $(G,K) = (\textrm{GL}_{2n}({\mathbb{C}}), \textrm{GL}_n({\mathbb{C}}) \times \textrm{GL}_n({\mathbb{C}}))$. Then the generalized Steinberg map is a map from partial permutations to the pairs of nilpotent orbits in $ \mathfrak{gl}_n({\mathbb{C}}) $. It involves a generalization of the classical Robinson–Schensted correspondence to the case of partial permutations. The other map, the exotic moment map, establishes a combinatorial map from the set of partial permutations to that of signed Young diagrams, that is, the set of nilpotent $ K$-orbits in the Cartan space $(\textrm{Lie}(G)/\textrm{Lie}(K))^* $. We explain the geometric background of the theory and combinatorial algorithms, which produce the above-mentioned maps.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717150","","","","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Following recent work in the continuous setting of Riemannian manifolds (by the 1st author), we then bound the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a graph under bounds on the volume growth. In particular, $\lambda _2$ of the graph can be bounded using a weighted discrete Hardy inequality and the higher eigenvalues of the graph can be bounded by the eigenvalues of a tridiagonal matrix times a multiplicative factor, both of which only depend on the volume growth of the graph. As a direct application, we relate the eigenvalues to the Cheeger isoperimetric constant. Using these methods, we describe classes of graphs for which the Cheeger inequality is tight on the 2nd eigenvalue (i.e. the 1st nonzero eigenvalue).

We next consider factorization for more robust groups of homeomorphisms. We refer to this as root subgroup factorization (because the factors correspond to root subgroups).

Second, in the same spirit, for two 4th-order Steklov eigenvalue problems studied by Kuttler and Sigillito in 1968, we deduce an optimal lower bound for their eigenvalue gaps in terms of either $h^{\prime}(R)/h^3(R)$ or $h^{\prime}(R)/h(R)$ when $n=2$ and the Gaussian curvature is nonnegative.

In brief, it reduces the problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to a problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n - 1}$ via integralgeometric considerations. For the case $n = 1$, a short geometric proof already exists in the literature. A similar proof technique applies to parabolic Lipschitz functions $f \colon \mathbb{R}^{n - 1} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. A natural Dorronsoro estimate in this class is known, due to Hofmann. The method presented here allows one to reduce the parabolic problem to the Euclidean one and to obtain an elementary proof also in this setting. As a corollary, I deduce an analogue of Rademacher's theorem for parabolic Lipschitz functions.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnz317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687390","","","","","","","","","","20 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To do this, we develop a method based on the work of Jimbo, Miwa, and Ueno from the theory of isomonodromic deformations. Specifically, we introduce a system of equations that is equivalent to the isomonodromy equations of Jimbo–Miwa–Ueno, but which is adapted to the decomposition of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ as a direct sum of irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$. Using properties of some structure constants for $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ to analyze this system of equations, we show that deformations of certain families of cyclic $\textrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$-opers on the Riemann sphere with a single pole are never infinitesimally isomonodromic.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rnaa047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687352","","","","","","","","","","20 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here $\mathfrak{G}$ is a flat affine group scheme of finite type over a smooth projective curve $C$ over a finite field. Global $\mathfrak{G}$-shtukas are generalizations of Drinfeld shtukas and analogs of abelian varieties with additional structure. We prove that the moduli stacks of global $\mathfrak{G}$-shtukas are algebraic Deligne–Mumford stacks separated and locally of finite type. They generalize various moduli spaces used by different authors to prove instances of the Langlands program over function fields. In the 1st article we explained the relation between global $\mathfrak{G}$-shtukas and local ${{\mathbb{P}}}$-shtukas, which are the function field analogs of $p$-divisible groups. Here ${{\mathbb{P}}}$ is the base change of $\mathfrak{G}$ to the complete local ring at a point of $C$. When ${{\mathbb{P}}}$ is smooth with connected reductive generic fiber we proved the existence of Rapoport–Zink spaces for local ${{\mathbb{P}}}$-shtukas. In the present article we use these spaces to (partly) uniformize the moduli stacks of global $\mathfrak{G}$-shtukas for smooth $\mathfrak{G}$ with connected fibers and reductive generic fiber.

In dimension $n=1$, we construct an elliptic singular integral operator $H_{\flat } $ for which the energy conditions are not necessary for boundedness of $H_{\flat }$. The convolution kernel $K_{\flat }\left ( x\right ) $ of the operator $H_{\flat }$ is a smooth flattened version of the Hilbert transform kernel $K\left ( x\right ) =\frac{1}{x}$ that satisfies ellipticity $ \vert K_{\flat }\left ( x\right ) \vert \gtrsim \frac{1}{\left \vert x\right \vert }$, but not gradient ellipticity $ \vert K_{\flat }^{\prime }\left ( x\right ) \vert \gtrsim \frac{1}{ \vert x \vert ^{2}}$. Indeed the kernel has flat spots where $K_{\flat }^{\prime }\left ( x\right ) =0$ on a family of intervals, but $K_{\flat }^{\prime }\left ( x\right ) $ is otherwise negative on $\mathbb{R}\setminus \left \{ 0\right \} $. On the other hand, if a one-dimensional kernel $K\left ( x,y\right ) $ is both elliptic and gradient elliptic, then the energy conditions are necessary, and so by our theorem in [30], the $T1$ theorem holds for such kernels on the line.

This natural sensation is critical for amputees who employ a prosthetic hand for everyday tasks such as holding or gripping objects. The use of silicone as an artificial skin covering on the fingertips of a prosthetic hand has the potential to significantly decrease the amount of force necessary to hold an object since silicone can improve the ability to mimic the sensation of touch. An experiment was conducted with a 3D-printed prosthetic hand to measure the force required to hold a common object such as a water bottle. Trials were conducted for both an uncovered prosthetic hand and the prosthetic hand covered with silicone skin, and the force was measured using an Arduino UNO microcontroller board in conjunction with a force sensitive resistor (FSR). The results of this experiment supported that the use of silicone skin on the fingertips of the prosthetic hand resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of force necessary to hold an object, likely due to its frictional properties. This work provides new insights into the design of artificial skins and the calibration of force feedback for prosthetic hands.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668890","prosthetics;haptic systems;tactile sensing","Resistors;Force measurement;Prosthetic limbs;Microcontrollers;Force;Force feedback;Skin","artificial limbs;biomechanics;force feedback;force sensors;friction;microcontrollers;resistors;skin;tactile sensors","artificial skin;uncovered prosthetic hand;silicone skin;prosthetic limbs;Arduino UNO microcontroller;force sensitive resistor;frictional properties;calibration","","","","10","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Confocal microscopy has been brought up as an option for synaptic imaging in the past (as compared to 2-photon microscopy), but one of its main drawbacks is the lack of options for processing, particularly in the context of synaptic imaging. Most existing pipelines, such as CaImAn, EZCalcium, etc. are designed for one/two photon microscopy and detect/analyze neuronal regions of interest (ROIs). Compared to neuronal calcium imaging, quantitative tools to analyze synaptic calcium signals in an automated manner are lacking due to the nanoscopic organization of synapses. To address this technical challenge, we developed a novel pipeline that analyzes synaptic ROIs to map the probability of synaptic transmission at the resolution of individual active zones: PACISCA. The pipeline has four main components: synapse annotation/image motion correction, flash identification, fluorescence tracing, and probability mapping. Our work provides an efficient computational framework to analyze synaptic calcium imaging signals from neuroscience experiments studying synaptic functions. Improving the reliability of our analytic tool on larger datasets will be the next steps of this work.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668612","","Neuroscience;Calcium;Microscopy;Pipelines;Organizations;Probabilistic logic;Reliability","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical optical imaging;brain;calcium;cellular biophysics;fluorescence;medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;optical microscopy;probability","confocally imaged synaptic calcium activity;PACISCA;neuronal activity patterns;neural networks;animal behavior;neural activity;confocal microscopy;synaptic imaging;2-photon microscopy;existing pipelines;neuronal regions;neuronal calcium imaging;synaptic calcium signals;pipeline;analyzes synaptic ROIs;synaptic transmission;individual active zones;synaptic functions;probabilistic analysis","","","","10","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brain tumors can spread very quickly to other parts of the brain and the spinal cord unless necessary preventive action is taken. Thus, the survival rate for this disease is less than 40% for both men and women. A conclusive and early diagnosis of a brain tumor could be the difference between life and death for some. However, brain tumor detection and segmentation are tedious and time-consuming processes as it can only be done by radiologists and clinical experts. The use of computer vision techniques, such as Mask R Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R CNN), to detect and segment brain tumors can mitigate the possibility of human error while increasing prediction accuracy rates. The goal of this project is to create an assistive diagnostics tool for brain tumor detection and segmentation. Transfer learning was used with the Mask R CNN, and necessary parameters were accordingly altered, as a starting point. The model was trained with 20 epochs and later tested. The prediction segmentation matched 90% with the ground truth. This suggests that the model was able to perform at a high level. Once the model was finalized, the application running on Flask was created. The application will serve as a tool for medical professionals. It allows doctors to upload patient brain tumor MRI images in order to receive immediate results on the diagnosis and segmentation for each patient.

The effect of data preprocessing on clustering was systematically studied. Further analyses demonstrate the immediate value of our clusters for both retrospective interpretation of the pandemic and as informative inputs for case prediction models. We visualize the time progression of COVID-19 from April 5, 2020 to August 23, 2020.

Early diagnoses are vital for successful recoveries, but with conventional diagnostic imaging techniques and computer systems, radiologists misdiagnose more than 20% of all ischemic strokes. AI methods have been developed for automated neurological disorder prediction using electroencephalographic (EEG) data, but artificial and recurrent classifiers have still seen mediocre performance. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), however, have demonstrated their capacity in personalized spatio-and spectro-temporal non-stationary time series data modeling and pattern recognition. This study developed an SNN model that can detect cerebral ischaemia from temporal EEG data with an accuracy of 94.45%, far exceeding the performance of traditional stroke models operating on computerized tomography data. The approach outlined also required a significantly low number of training samples, having been trained and evaluated on an EEG corpus with recordings from 46 stroke patients and 46 healthy individuals, in addition to being scalable to other neurodegenerative diseases and mental illnesses. Ultimately, the diagnostic precision of the SNN can be adapted in professional environments to replace or be in conjunction with other computerized medical systems to improve ischemic stroke prognosis and recovery.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668895","Bio-inspired computing;computer-aided diagnosis;electroencephalography;spiking neural network;stroke","Training;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Supervised learning;Stroke (medical condition);Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","brain;computerised tomography;diseases;electroencephalography;medical image processing;medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;signal classification;time series","conventional diagnostic imaging techniques;computer systems;AI methods;automated neurological disorder prediction;electroencephalographic data;artificial classifiers;recurrent classifiers;mediocre performance;neural networks;personalized spatio;SNN model;temporal EEG data;traditional stroke models;computerized tomography data;46 stroke patients;computerized medical systems;ischemic stroke prognosis;computer-aided ischemic stroke classification;single-tiered spiking neural network framework;common cerebrovascular conditions;global mortality rates;successful recoveries","","","","30","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The insulation (either solid or fluid) breaks due to other types of stress such as thermal or mechanical as well. Undetected PD leads to larger faults, arc flash and substantial damages to power systems assets. Over the past decades, different techniques have been developed for PD detection based on the nature, intensity, and location of such a fault. In general, external PD falls into two major categories: a) surface discharge, and b) corona. PD induces electromagnetic and audio responses that can be used for detection. This project explores spectrum analysis of audio signals that can be used to detect and classify audible PD (surface and corona). This exploration is performed on several Tesla-coil music as well as its normal instrumentation. Tesla-coil music may have features helpful in detecting PD especially when many real-world cases of PD are not readily available for analysis.

Environmental exposures, particularly contaminated drinking water and phthalates, chemicals widely used in industrial and consumer applications, are thought to contribute to preterm birth. We used data from a birth cohort based in the northern region of Puerto Rico, known as PROTECT, to examine phthalate levels in drinking water and corresponding phthalate concentrations in the urine of pregnant women. We identified and evaluated predictors of preterm birth based on these findings. In this project, we performed two analyses: i) compared tap water contaminant concentrations and participant health status, and ii) evaluated associations between water and urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites. We leveraged Decision Trees to predict preterm birth and learn the important features. We addressed the issue of using highly imbalanced data by utilizing an AUC split criterion. For the tap water model we found the key features included health indicators, phthalate concentrations, and water pipe materials. For the urine phthalate model we found the most important features to be MCNP and MCOP, followed by 12 additional phthalates. The most important features for the tap water model indicated that health, water processing, and phthalate levels were crucial to accurately predicting adverse birth outcomes using our analysis.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668857","","Pregnancy;Water storage;Filtration;Conferences;Predictive models;Water pollution;Data models","contamination;decision trees;employee welfare;obstetrics;occupational health;pattern classification;pipes;water treatment","health outcomes;Decision Trees;preterm birth;Puerto Rico;serious public health issue;environmental exposures;drinking water;birth cohort;phthalate levels;corresponding phthalate concentrations;participant health status;evaluated associations;urinary concentrations;phthalate metabolites;tap water model;health indicators;water pipe materials;urine phthalate model;12 additional phthalates;water processing;adverse birth outcomes","","","","12","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the passive approach, the pod was modeled with highly noise absorbent and reflective materials to most effectively attenuate sound waves. For the active approach, electronic components were utilized to collect and output signals, and a Filtered-x Least Mean Square (LMS) Finite Impulse Response (FIR) adaptive filter was created to process the input noise and produce the anti-noise. It was determined that polyurethane foam and double-glazed plexiglass are the best materials for sound absorption, rounded edges are the best structure for sound reflection, and an LMS step size of 0.008 provides the best adaptive filtering.

To remedy the need for a compact description of the electronic structure, we develop tight-binding models derived from atomic-orbital and maximally-localized Wannier function bases to describe the valence and conduction band states of the monoclinic and rhombohedral structural phases of Ga2O3. This model accurately reproduces key features of their electronic structure, a necessary step towards the general description of the functional behaviors of Ga2O3 in heterostructures and devices.

Consequently, real-time analysis of EEG signals during anesthesia administration is a promising technique to monitor patient states. Moreover, EEG has the potential to be the prime brain-monitoring technique for the creation of a closed-loop anesthesia delivery (CLAD) system. Machine learning (ML) software that can classify EEG time samples as conscious or unconscious is necessary for further CLAD system development. Burst suppression, a common metabolic phenomenon in deeply unconscious patients, presents a unique challenge to engineering an effective classifier. In this project, a previously engineered EEG classifier was replicated using band wise power (BWP) and principal component analysis (PCA) as features in a logistic regression classifier. The classifier performed well on the training data (BWP AUC <tex>${=0.94428}$</tex>, PCA AUC <tex>${=0.96096}$</tex>) and validation sets (BWP Mean AUC <tex>${=0.94426}$</tex>, SEM <tex>${=0.0010468}$</tex>, PCA Mean AUC <tex>${=0.96099}$</tex>, SEM <tex>${=0.0010535}$</tex>) but performed poorly when burst suppression samples were isolated for performance (BWP Hit rate <tex>${=0.4062}$</tex>, PCA Hit rate <tex>${=0.4330}$</tex>). Two new supervised ML approaches, support vector machines (SVM) and single-layer artificial neural networks (ANN), were utilized to improve classifier performance on burst suppression samples. As a result, the best performing classifier, PCA trained SVM, generated a burst suppression hit rate of 0.9598 on the training set and 0.8660 on the testing set while maintaining an AUC of 0.94714. While this project demonstrates that a classifier utilizing PCA with SVM is a promising avenue for robustly characterizing EEG signals in the presence of burst suppression, we conclude that dynamic preprocessing normalization techniques need to be implemented for optimal performance without overfitting.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668878","National Science Foundation (NSF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668878","electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis;propofol;consciousness;closed-loop anesthesia delivery (CLAD);machine learning (ML);burst suppression;logistic regression (LR);band-wise power (BWP);principal component analysis (PCA);support vector machine (SVM);artificial neural network (ANN)","Training;Training data;Support vector machine classification;Artificial neural networks;Anesthesia;Electroencephalography;Software","electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical control systems;medical signal processing;neural nets;pattern classification;principal component analysis;regression analysis;support vector machines","deeply unconscious patients;principal component analysis;logistic regression classifier;BWP AUC;PCA AUC;BWP Mean AUC;SEM;PCA Mean AUC;burst suppression samples;PCA Hit rate;supervised ML approaches;support vector machines;classifier performance;burst suppression hit rate;EEG signals;dynamic preprocessing normalization techniques;propofol-induced unconsciousness;anesthesia delivery yields;electroen-cephalogram signatures;real-time analysis;anesthesia administration;patient states;prime brain-monitoring technique;closed-loop anesthesia delivery system;machine learning software;CLAD system development;metabolic phenomenon","","","","16","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel method of diagnosis to shorten time, resources, and uncertainty during this process. This predictive machine learning model uses eye tracking (ET) and follows saccadic eye movements in patients to identify patterns, irregularities, and fixation time as symptoms of ASD. The results of experimental testing show that the Two Class Boosted Decision Tree is the most accurate model to use, with an estimated accuracy score of 88–91%.

Input shaping is a control approach that is used on a variety of systems, such as Gantry cranes, and has been attempted for sling-load systems in the past. Input shaping can be implemented via a helicopter's Stability Augmentation System. To test the effectiveness of input shaping on helicopter sling-load systems, a model is developed to simulate helicopter and load movement for a sling-load system subject to external forcing. The input-shaped results using state feedback control show marginal stability of the load and significant residual movement of the aircraft. Using PID control, the input-shaped results show stability after a significant settling time, and greater helicopter movement than the state feedback control.

Continuously innovation of neural network architectures is making it more correct and efficient every day. But training a neural network from scratch is a very time-consuming and requires a lot of sophisticated computational equipments and power. So, using some pre-trained neural network as feature extractor for any image classification task or “Transfer Learning” is very popular approach that saves time and computational power for practical use of CNN s. In this paper an efficient way of building full model from any pre-trained model with high accuracy and low memory, is proposed using Knowledge Distillation. Using the distilled knowledge of the last layer of pretrained networks is passes through fully-connected layers with different hidden layers, followed by Softmax layer. The accuracies of student networks are mildly lesser than the whole models, but accuracy of student models clearly indicates the accuracy of the real network. In this way the best number of hidden layers for dense layer for that pretrained network with best accuracy and no-over-fitting can be found with less time. Here VGG16 and VGG19 (pre-trained on “ImageNet” dataset) is tested on chest X-rays (pneumonia and COVID-19). For finding the best number of hidden layers total it saves nearly 44 minutes for VGG19 and 36 minutes 37 seconds for VGG16 feature extractor based CNN model.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668874","Deep Learning;Transfer Learning;Knowledge Distillation;Image Classification","Training;Technological innovation;Computational modeling;Pulmonary diseases;Transfer learning;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;pattern classification","hidden neuron count;transfer learning;knowledge distillation;neural network architectures;sophisticated computational equipments;pretrained neural network;image classification task;computational power;distilled knowledge;pretrained network;fully-connected layers;hidden layers;Softmax layer;student networks;student models;dense layer;VGG19;VGG16 feature extractor;CNN model","","","","20","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the human brain cannot simultaneously process and analyze large amounts of data, the application of machine learning could enable this process more efficient and precise. Our framework is to combine simple machine learning models with traditional factor analysis to quantitatively invest. We consider the stock prediction process as a classification problem and use the random forest classifier to make the factors as input features and the prediction of good stocks as target values. Then create a monthly-running trading strategy according to model prediction to gain excess profits. To optimize our model, we can analyze factors to replace model training inputs and select the hyperparameters through grid-search to improve the performance of prediction. Additionally, we explored the feature importance of factors and the order of searching hyperparameters on model optimization, which can lead us to upgrade the model itself. In the end, this paper delivers a full practice on the utilization of machine learning with factor analysis in quantitative strategy.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668910","quantitative investment;machine learning;random forest;hyperparameter","Training;Analytical models;Profitability;Machine learning;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Security","investment;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;profitability;stock markets","quantitative strategy;stock selection;securities institutions;investment companies;quantitative models;experienced analysts;stable returns;higher excess returns;human brain;simple machine learning models;traditional factor analysis;stock prediction process;classification problem;random forest classifier;good stocks;trading strategy;model prediction;excess profits;model training inputs;model optimization","","","","14","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research question we have is whether Internet of Things (loT) and mobile engineering techniques can help monitor muscle conditions, such as overuse of muscles, muscle recovery from surgery, etc. We propose MusCare, a microcontroller-based system with EMG sensors and an Android mobile app, to help monitor muscle status and visualize the results for the users. The current results show that the system can provide real-time monitoring results on a mobile device. In addition, a neural network algorithm was able to be implemented on a mobile phone to detect anomalies from the EMG data. Currently, the prototype system uses a MyoWare EMG sensor to keep track of the targeted muscle group, but the design of the system can be extended to work with vibrators to provide an advanced improvement in the interaction.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668896","EMG sensor;Bluetooth;Microcontroller;Mobile App Development;Muscular Disorders","Target tracking;Surgery;Prototypes;Muscles;Electromyography;Sensor systems;Real-time systems","diseases;electromyography;medical control systems;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;mobile computing","mobile design;muscle monitoring;muscular disorders;muscular dystrophy;muscle atrophy;muscle mass;Internet of Things;mobile engineering techniques;muscle conditions;muscle recovery;microcontroller-based system;EMG sensors;Android mobile app;muscle status;real-time monitoring results;mobile device;mobile phone;prototype system;MyoWare EMG sensor;targeted muscle group;MusCare microcontroller-based system","","1","","29","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data from prior administrations of the CARE at two elementary schools in South Carolina was parsed and read into dictionaries that contained a randomly created ID number, the student's gender and grade level, and their scores on the individual assessments they were administered. A neural network was created in Python using prominent machine learning libraries, taking test scores as inputs and attempting to train gender as an output [16]. Since not every student was administered every assessment, only assessments that had been taken by more than 60% of the students were used in the neural network (see Fig. 1). These assessments were used to train the neural network to detect gender. After repeated attempts to train the network to this data set failed, a data set of similar size from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository was used to test the network built to determine if there was a structural defect in its construction [15]. As shown in Figure 3, the constructed network was able to train to an appropriate degree on the data set from UC Irvine but despite repeated attempts was unable to train on the data with respect to gender from the CARE administrations. From this, it was interpreted that the CARE data follows similar patterns to previous studies of other tests of reading disabilities, which concluded that students in lower grades show insignificant differences in reading ability by gender.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668866","University of South Carolina; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668866","machine learning;neural networks;dyslexia;reading disabilities;artificial intelligence;computer screening","Dictionaries;Conferences;Neural networks;Machine learning;Libraries","computer aided instruction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","neural network;gender bias;student;Carolina Automated Reading Evaluation;South Carolina;randomly created ID number;data set;constructed network;CARE data","","","","19","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is essential to diagnose it early so that health care professionals can prevent the chance of a person spreading the virus. Because the disease often presents with respiratory symptoms, one method for detecting it is by radiology examination using chest radiography. Healthcare professionals examine the chest X-ray for abnormalities that are characteristics of those infected with COVID-19, which must be distinguished from other conditions with similar presentation such as pneumonia. This requires significant expertise, which may not be available in all parts of the world, so computer assisted diagnosis would be highly beneficial. We propose a deep neural network for extracting those abnormalities as features and classifying the infection. In this study, we examine the efficiency of small-sized deep neural network tailored for the detection of COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray (CXR) images. We designed a modified version of SqueezeNet and Capsule Network and show that even with a relatively small number of free parameters, it can achieve a competitive result while having modest hardware requirements. We use a modified version of fire modules to ensure better convergence. For our Capsule network, we used fire modules as two of its upper layers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a fire module has been used in conjunction with capsules. Without any pretraining or transfer learning, our SqueezeNet was able to achieve an accuracy of 94.8 %, sensitivity of 88.0 %, and specificity of 98.4%.

Even as some social media platforms take initiative with labels or warnings, fake news continues to have dangerous consequences beyond misinformation. The goal of this research is to implement an effective method of identifying fake news spread on Twitter through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). More specifically, the investigation studied Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) networks to compare their accuracy when predicting fake news. Data was preprocessed and used to train AI models; figures were then generated for analysis. All three models achieved high accuracy in detecting fake news; however, the NLP model was the only iteration that possessed the ability to identify satire as fake news. For this reason, the NLP model was deemed the preferred choice for detecting fake news on Twitter.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668872","Rutgers University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668872","","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Conferences;Blogs;Machine learning;Logic gates;Natural language processing","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;social networking (online);text analysis","Twitter;fake news;machine learning models;social media platforms;artificial intelligence;long short term memory;gated recurrent unit;natural language processing networks;NLP model","","2","","15","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In all cases, regardless of conductor diameter, the research found that Al-Ca conductor displayed superior conductivity versus ACSR. With greater conductivity, circuits made of Al-Ca would experience less power loss from resistive heating. In addition, the research found that the superior yield strength of Al-Ca allowed for longer span lengths; consequently, a transmission circuit built using Al-Ca would require fewer support towers than the same circuit built using ACSR. As support towers can comprise as much as half of construction costs, using Al-Ca can lead to significant savings.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668908","Al-Ca;ACSR;impedance;conductor;conductivity;composite;power transmission","Heating systems;Renewable energy sources;Costs;Power transmission lines;Poles and towers;Conductivity;Conductors","aluminium;calcium;composite materials;conductors (electric);costing;poles and towers;power grids;power transmission economics;power transmission lines;renewable energy sources;steel;yield strength","Al-Ca conductor;ACSR;power loss;transmission line construction;renewable energy projects;cost benefits;aluminum conductor steel reinforced conductor;aluminum-calcium composite conductor;America power grid cost;resistive heating;yield strength;support towers;frequency 50.0 Hz;frequency 60.0 Hz;Al-Ca","","","","3","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The standard Gradient Boosting Classifier is one algorithm that works well on balanced data with completely labeled examples but performs poorly otherwise. In order to improve upon this state-of-the-art method, we propose a modification to its loss function that empowers it to learn a decision boundary more reflective of the data's true distribution.

While nerve-replicating sensors have been prototyped, low-latency reflex action is still not feasible with control systems that process sensory inputs subsequent to operational logic. We propose a robot-environment interaction protocol in which functionalized digital fibers with embedded sensors act as modular reflexogenic ‘garments’, outsourcing reflex computation to interchangeable sensory extremities and conferring artificial somatosensory reflexes to robots for effective adaptation to different tasks, target objects, environments, or use cases. By programming application-specific digital fibers with context-aware reflex thresholds, in-fiber microcontrollers can detect stimulus magnitude and generate digital interrupt signals, causing a predetermined reflex action to be activated from a central control system. As a proof of concept, digital fibers with embedded temperature sensors were used to model a “thermal glove” attachment and integrated with a 5-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. This prototype offers a testbed for the evaluation of reflexory function in a robot that contracts an extended manipulator arm in response to ambient or contact exposure to high temperatures, similar to the “hot stove” reflex arc of human arm motion. Even with relatively low-speed digital communications, rapid reflexory signal transmission can be achieved: while operating at I2C clock cycle speeds, sensory data collection and computation, threshold checking, and motion-triggering interrupt signal transmission can be completed up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than with conventional centralized computation of sensory inputs. With this protocol, separate sensorimotor reflexes can be added as needed with independent functionalized attachments, decreasing reflex latency and minimizing the computational load that main processors need to devote to computing sensory reflex actions. Modular sensory attachments decrease the need for complex centralized sensing systems or continuous reprogramming in preparation for separate tasks; this can reduce cost and time overhead incurred during equipment turnaround in operations leveraging robotic complements to human labor. In addition, these reflex fibers can be used to improve robotic spatial and sensory awareness and facilitate more efficient interactions with the robot's environment, improving balance and other tactile reflexes in humanoid / agile robots and enabling more effective bionic prosthetics and bioinspired robotic platforms.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668863","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DMR-1419807); US Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF-13-D-000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668863","artificial reflexes;robotic sensing;digital fibers;robot-environment interaction;control systems","Temperature sensors;Optical fiber sensors;Protocols;Educational robots;Robot sensing systems;Manipulators;Control systems","biomechanics;digital communication;humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;intelligent sensors;manipulator dynamics;microcontrollers;mobile robots;motion control;neurocontrollers;neurophysiology;path planning;patient rehabilitation;prosthetics;sensor fusion;telerobotics;temperature sensors;wireless sensor networks","context-aware artificial somatosensory reflexes;sensor-embedded fibers;robotic control systems;nerve-replicating sensors;low-latency reflex action;operational logic;embedded sensors;modular reflexogenic garments;outsourcing reflex computation;application-specific digital fibers;context-aware reflex thresholds;in-fiber microcontrollers;digital interrupt signals;thermal glove attachment;robotic manipulator;human arm motion;low-speed digital communications;rapid reflexory signal transmission;motion-triggering interrupt signal transmission;robotic spatial awareness;bioinspired robotic platforms;adaptive robot-environment interaction;artificial somatosensory reflexes;sensory data collection;humanoid-agile robots;bionic prosthetics","","2","","15","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pulse examination is one of two practices used in palpation. The doctors normally put three fingers on top of the patient's wrist and determine the type of pulse with different pressing level. Each finger position is related to a specific organ. With each press and a reflection from the pulse, the doctors gain knowledge of their patient's organ condition, which normally is combined with multiple factors, such as diet, urine color, skin color, etc. and can finalize their diagnosis. In this research, we argue that it is possible to shorten the gap to support TCM doctors to diagnose patients in distance.

Despite their merits, lithium-ion batteries also have significant safety concerns, demonstrated by the several instances of these batteries catching fire or exploding. To ensure future battery safety, it is imperative to develop accurate testing procedures and determine the factors leading to catastrophic failure. The Oxford Mathematical Modelling Battery Group's Python Battery Mathematical Model (PyBaMM) was used to simulate these batteries in action along with experimental data from Dr. Thomas Hodson's lab at Columbia University [1]. By comparing these different types of data and exploring each individually, it was determined that discharge rate and repeated cycling are the leading causes of thermal runaway in lithiumion batteries. It was also determined that PyBaMM, despite showing general trends of different factors that led to combustion, was unviable in the simulation of battery explosions due to its failure to recognize explosive battery temperatures and inability to simulate both realistic thermal behavior and heat exchange between cells and the surrounding environment.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668905","","Lithium-ion batteries;Heating systems;Thermodynamics;Renewable energy sources;Market research;Mathematical models;Data models","lithium compounds;mathematical analysis;Python;renewable energy sources;safety;secondary cells","lithium-ion battery failure;renewable energy sources;energy storage;catching fire;catastrophic failure;Oxford mathematical modelling battery groups python battery mathematical model;PyBaMM;Dr. Thomas Hodsons lab;Columbia university;thermal behavior;recognize explosive battery","","","","10","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, object permanence is often left out of machine vision models designed to identify objects in video. As machine vision technology becomes more widespread, it is important to understand the key differences between machine and human visual processing, and how we can bridge these gaps. In order to compare object permanence capabilities in humans and machine models, we created a custom video dataset of objects undergoing occlusion, including frames with partial and full occlusions. Human object detection performance on the dataset was assessed via survey, and compared with the SOTA object detection algorithm YOLOv3, as well as a novel recurrence-based model we call YOLO-LSTM. Although human performance degrades significantly when identifying object size and location under occlusion, human subjects almost always recognize that occluded objects still exist, while YOLOv3 shows linearly decreasing performance as objects become more occluded. YOLO-LSTM has a lower accuracy overall than YOLO-v3, but demonstrates more humanlike behavior.","","978-1-7281-7571-3","10.1109/URTC51696.2020.9668864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668864","deep neural networks;object permanence;machine vision","Bridges;Visualization;Conferences;Object detection;Cognition;Object recognition","cognition;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;recurrent neural nets;video signal processing","object size;object occlusion;human ability;human cognition;machine vision;human visual processing;object permanence;custom video dataset;human object detection performance;DNN performance;object localization;YOLO-LSTM;recurrence-based model","","","","10","IEEE","17 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart meters provide information at the consumer level, which could be used as the main source for real-time energy micro-transactions, however, one of the main concerns about direct transactions is information security. Conventional electricity markets rely on centralized information exchange, nevertheless, when intra-day, distributed, electricity consumption and production exchanges are required between customers, this approach might not be enough. This paper presents a proof-of-concept for using Blockchain as a tool for managing the operational transactions in a DC microgrid. The distributed nature of this technology provides an inherently safer approach, by providing an immutable database for transaction history. One of the challenges of using this technology, however, is the required computing power at the nodes and the limited capacity available in the smart meter. To overcome these issues, the authors used a distributed computing technology, -edge computing-, where computation and storage are located closer to the customer, to improve response times by handling the required computational tasks of the Blockchain tool. This approach proved not only to be practically viable but also, offers important insights about the scalability and capabilities of the technology.","","978-1-6654-2935-1","10.1109/TESC50295.2020.9656872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656872","Microgrids;Blockchain;Edge Computing;Smart Grids;DER","Transactive energy;Object oriented modeling;Computational modeling;Microgrids;Libraries;Smart meters;Blockchains","distributed power generation;power consumption;power markets;renewable energy sources","distributed energy resources parameter monitoring;microgrids;increased share;distributed renewable energy sources;flexible tools;reliable electricity;cheap electricity;smart meter;consumer level;real-time energy microtransactions;direct transactions;information security;conventional electricity markets;centralized information exchange;intra-day;electricity consumption;production exchanges;operational transactions;DC microgrid;inherently safer approach;transaction history;required computing power;distributed computing technology;edge computing;response times;required computational tasks;Blockchain tool","","","","24","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We describe a prototype which simulates the behavior of the auction system and its participants who negotiate prices with individual bidding strategies. The proposed system allows the participants to transact without seeking numerous quantity-price trading pairs, thereby protecting confidentiality of cost curves of each competing participant. A less information-rich input does introduce some element of higher price volatility as an outcome, which, in this context, can be tolerated as parties perform small-ticket transactions.

For distribution networks, prices for securing reserves from the transmission system may become high. A potentially superior (and possibly cheaper) resource to secure these reserves might be flexible, deferrable, controllable loads within the distribution network such as air-conditioning devices, electric vehicles and water heaters. In this paper, we present a cooptimization formulation for a distribution network and use the formulation to explore impacts of demand-side flexibility on power system reserve prices under different scenarios. These scenarios correspond to different levels of flexibility embedded within the demand as well as different levels of elasticity costs, which reflect the willingness of consumers to offer demand flexibility. Empirical studies with the proposed optimization framework suggest that the reserve prices within a power distribution network are impacted by the dynamics of the flexible loads, elasticity costs, the costs of exporting energy and reserves from the external bulk transmission grid, and the amount of generation available from distributed energy resources (DERs) within the distribution network.","","978-1-6654-2935-1","10.1109/TESC50295.2020.9656934","Battelle; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656934","distribution systems;reserve prices;demand flexibility;transactive energy;optimization","Transactive energy;Renewable energy sources;Costs;Systems operation;Water heating;Distribution networks;Elasticity","demand side management;distributed power generation;elasticity;optimisation;power distribution control;power distribution economics;power grids;power transmission control;power transmission economics;pricing","power system reserve prices;power distribution network;flexible loads;distributed energy resources;time-varying demand flexibility;renewable energy resources;associated forecast errors;power transmission system;load control;cooptimization formulation;elasticity costs;external bulk transmission grid;DER","","","","16","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, to succeed in the management and guarantee the dynamic balance between consumption and supply, it is essential to count on reliable agents that can fulfill their agreements. Currently, generation companies and large consumers have experience as decision-makers in wholesale electricity markets, and this condition facilitates their participation in TE systems. In contrast, the residential sector has mostly had a passive role in electricity markets. As a consequence, the expansion of TE systems to distribution grids requires not only the implementation of communication channels and market rules but also the development of tools that engage small consumers and producers. Facilitating and automating the participation in transactions will build trust in the TE systems and accelerate their deployment. In this regard, this paper presents an agent architecture based on a beliefs-desires-intention approach to automate residential prosumers’ decision process. The architecture is composed of six behaviors that consider the interaction with internal and external household environments, appliances modeling, and consumption planning. This architecture was illustrated in simulated transactions employing a heating system as a controllable load.

Furthermore, transactive energy places economic theory as a cornerstone in its operational concept as it seeks to integrate the technical needs of the power system with the preferences of its participants. Traditionally the mechanism employed is the continuous double-auction, but depending on the circumstances in which the power system finds itself, this mechanism may or may not be the most appropriate; that is, a one-size-fits-all market institution cannot be recommended without regard for the features of the underlying trading environment. To better understand which types of mechanisms are most appropriate under what circumstances, this paper explains the economic rationale that guides the choice of a market institution and uses a theoretical demonstration in the context of a rationed power system scenario in which demand exceeds generation (due to any number of events such as outages, microgrid operation, etc.) and electrical energy must be rationed.","","978-1-6654-2935-1","10.1109/TESC50295.2020.9656939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656939","transactive energy;power system economics;economic theory;market institutions;market environments;power rationing","Economics;Transactive energy;Conferences;Microgrids;Power systems;Resource management","power generation economics;power markets","market institution;trading environment;power system operations;whole-sale markets;transactive energy;continuous double-auction;economic theory;electrical energy;rationed power system;allocation mechanism","","","","24","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On this paper we present a Peer-to-Peer energy trading based on Blockchain, taking into consideration some of the physical constraints on the distribution network. The objective of the model presented is to help the substation on-peak hours while enabling users to have more control on their contributions into the grid, with the focus on the use of renewable energies as a flexible source.

In particular, these methods can be used to identify error states emerging from precise interactions between multiple subsystems that would occur only after long periods of testing, operation, or stacked error conditions. This approach has been applied to eliminate errors in commercial software systems, networking, industrial controls, and increasingly in energy applications. We have recently demonstrated the use of standard distribution feeders as a basis for TLA+ models in order to provide a test setup for investigating distributed energy control algorithms. Here we examine a distribution feeder under conditions in which a transmission outage curtails slack bus power flows. While conventional grid architectures under these conditions would de-energize the feeder and require nodes with distributed energy resources (DERs) to operate in islanded mode, we model control algorithms for a transactive energy system in which DERs are able to sell power to neighboring nodes. A modular architecture is used to add new node and feeder capabilities, such as the ability to buy and sell energy in hyperlocal distribution markets, as module upgrades while containing modifications to the control system used to operate the feeder. This approach allows the resiliency benefits of transactive energy to be gained while minimizing implementation costs through the reduction of complexity. We model a laminar coordination framework and use TLA+ to formally verify its operation. Using this formal specification, we investigate the latency of coordination signals over a range of system states and identify conditions for stable operation. We show that while allowing energy transactions between peers on a feeder improves system resilience by permitting continued operation despite the failure of transmission infrastructure, care must be taken to address other failure modes that arise from this decentralized architecture which can be addressed through model checking. This work establishes formal verification as an invaluable tool for realization of the resiliency benefits of transactive energy by uncovering potential failure modes and providing engineers a chance to mitigate them before systems are commissioned.","","978-1-6654-2935-1","10.1109/TESC50295.2020.9656940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656940","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Transactive energy;Fault tolerance;Computer architecture;Power system stability;Software systems;Peer-to-peer computing;Optimization","cost reduction;distributed control;distributed power generation;failure analysis;formal specification;formal verification;industrial control;load flow;power control;power distribution control;power distribution economics;power generation control;power generation economics;power grids;power transmission control;power transmission economics;power transmission reliability","grid architecture;distributed energy resource;DER;neighboring node;modular architecture;system resilience;decentralized architecture;transactive energy control;formal verification tool;multiple subsystem;software system;industrial control;stacked error condition;standard distribution feeder;TLA model;distributed energy control algorithm;transmission outage curtails slack bus power flow;islanded mode;cost reduction;laminar coordination framework;potential failure mode","","","","11","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"An Estimation Model for the Number of EVs Required to Utilize V2G Technology","W. R. Rinaldi","Indianapolis, United States","2020 IEEE PES Transactive Energy Systems Conference (TESC)","28 Dec 2021","2020","","","1","5","Renewable energy generation continues to grow, but its variability problem remains. Battery energy storage is one potential way to solve this problem and more efficiently utilize existing renewable energy infrastructure. While grid level battery projects have begun, vehicle to grid (V2G) interaction with electric vehicles (EV) could add a significant amount of energy storage. This work estimates the number of electric vehicles needed to efficiently utilize variable renewable energy resources in California using V2G interaction. Efficient use of variable renewable energy resources is defined for this paper as creating a constant power demand for conventional energy generators, as opposed to variable demand resulting from renewable energy fluctuations. While the data analyzed is specific to California, the models used and overarching ""Vision for Participation"" can be applied to any interconnected power network. To estimate the number of EVs required, an analytical approach is developed to create a constant difference between the daily renewable energy generation and consumer demand profiles over the course of an average day using battery storage. This difference will not only be useful as a metric for renewable energy growth, but will help utilities more efficiently dispatch their conventional generators and size their conventional portfolio. Battery deterioration is a critical component of V2G since there would need to be some transaction incentivizing EV owners to participate in powering the grid in the previously mentioned way. While this work does not provide specific pricing to EV participants, it does quantify battery deterioration on a per-charge basis, which could inform future pricing models for grid interaction. The parametric model of the capacity fade of an EV battery is developed using a combination of laboratory data and EV usage data for the most common lithium ion battery chemistry, NCA. The analysis of these two models suggest that a total of 1-2 million EVs (there are currently around 600,000) are required to effectively use V2G technology to efficiently utilize the renewable energy capability of California.","","978-1-6654-2935-1","10.1109/TESC50295.2020.9656935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656935","Battery Deterioration;Electric Vehicle Depreciation;Smart Grid;Vehicle to Grid Technology","Warranties;Transactive energy;Vehicle-to-grid;Renewable energy sources;Analytical models;Upper bound;Pricing","demand side management;laboratory techniques;lithium compounds;load dispatching;power grids;power system interconnection;renewable energy sources;secondary cells;vehicle-to-grid","V2G technology;battery energy storage;grid level battery projects;electric vehicles;California;power demand;energy generators;renewable energy generation;battery deterioration;EV battery;vehicle to grid interaction;power network interconnection;consumer demand profiles;laboratory data;lithium ion battery;load dispatching","","","","19","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Metrology of reflector antennas: A historical review","J. W. M. Baars","Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie, 53121 Bonn, Germany, Priv. Prümer Wall 8 53359 Rheinbach, Germany","URSI Radio Science Bulletin","24 Dec 2021","2020","2020","375","10","32","The emergence of radio astronomy, space research, and satellite communication after World War II created great activity in the design and construction of reflector antennas of increasing size and precision, compared to the small radar antennas of the war period. With few exceptions, the reflectors consisted of a set of panels, typically a few square meters in size, that were supported on a backup structure. To be an effective reflector, the shape needs to obey the prescribed contour with a precision of about one-twentieth of the shortest operational wavelength. This was achieved with the aid of a continuously improving array of metrology methods, from the original geodetic theodolite-tape to current laser-trackers, digital photogrammetry, and radio holography. We review the historical development by summarizing the different methods and illustrating their applications with examples, mainly from the field of radio astronomy. It is here where the largest and most precise reflectors have been installed, and metrology has been pushed to a level where a reflector of 100 m diameter can be realized with a surface error of about 250 μm, and a 12 m diameter submillimeter telescope with an error of about 10 μm. The reference list is not exhaustive: it covers major papers of a general nature and detailed descriptions of the examples presented in the text. Table 1 provides a list of the acronyms used in the paper.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9663125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663125","","Temperature measurement;Telescopes;Strain;Radio astronomy;Optical surface waves;Metrology;Surface waves","","","","","","66","","24 Dec 2021","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

This profiler was named the Aries ST RADar (ASTRAD). The profiler was installed within a 30 m χ 30 m two-story building for better utilization of available space on a hilly terrain, surrounded by high-rise mountains. In an innovative way, 12 clusters of 49 elements were placed on the rooftop with the required precision in forming a quasi-circular aperture. Activation and integration of the clusters of the system progressed with extensive calibration of each individual transmitting/receiving module (TRM) connected with each antenna. During activation, the presence of a strong central patch in the Doppler-spectrum-like clutter, close to 0 Hz, was encountered. Based on experiments, it became clear that the reflected strength of the RF signal in the VHF band was significant due to the mountain terrain. A metal fence 3.5 m-4 m height was designed and installed at the perimeter of the rooftop to minimize the strength and to gain improvement in the detectability of the weak backscattered atmospheric signal. In this article, technical details of the system and design steps of the fence that led to overcoming the issue of clutter are summarized.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9663126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663126","","Antenna arrays;Radar;Wires;Radar antennas;Buildings;Aperture antennas;Clutter","","","","1","","15","","24 Dec 2021","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

As computational simulations demonstrate, when material and geometric properties — such as the shapes, sizes, and periodicities of the rods — are properly selected, these arrangements can behave like homogeneous objects with near-zero refractive indices. In SOLBOX-20, this phenomenon was shown by constructing triangular prisms and investigating the refraction of electromagnetic beams through them. Using cylindrical rods with 3.75 mm radius, 17 mm center-to-center periodicity, and 8.8 relative permittivity (corresponding to alumina), near-zero refractive index values could effectively be obtained at 10.3 GHz. As also shown in the same numerical set, modifying the material of the rods, i.e., using 4.0 relative permittivity, dramatically changed the behaviors of the structures, which seemed to possess ordinary refractive index values just above unity. Specifically, without using an appropriate material, such an arrangement of rods did not provide near-zero-index (NZI) characteristics, while the effective relative permittivity induced in the environment simply corresponded to that of a diluted material in vacuum.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9663130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663130","","Permittivity;Lattices;Dielectrics;Surface impedance;Surface waves;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Permeability","","","","","","13","","24 Dec 2021","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

The VERSIM workshop aims to bring together scientists from all across the globe to present and discuss topics related to the excitation, propagation, and effects of electromagnetic waves in the ELF/VLF (300 Hz – 30 kHz) range. The VERSIM group was established as a joint URSI/IAGA work group in 1975. It has been the main scientific body to specifically focus on whistlers in the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere (whistler waves were one of the first electromagnetic signals detected by ground instruments, and gave important clues about the Earth's active space environment). The scope of this group has grown substantially over the years. It has grown particularly in recent years with the recognition that whistler-mode chorus and hiss waves play a particularly important role in shaping the dynamics of the Earth's high-energy radiation belts (particularly topical in light of the continuing successful operation of the Van Allen Probes and the Arase (ERG) spacecraft). Whistler waves are also known to be intimately involved in the magnetic reconnection process (which is currently very topical due to the launch of the MMS satellite) and solar flaring. In addition to the traditional VERSIM topics, results of recent space missions, such as Arase, MMS, and the Van Allen Probes, were presented.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9663141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663141","","Conferences;Magnetosphere;Probes;Earth;Web sites;Space vehicles;Space radiation","","","","","","","","24 Dec 2021","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

This paper presents a generative method based on the RoBERTa model to extract sentiment support words or phrases. Although it is not necessarily better than the extraction method in common indicators, the generative method can truly understand sentence semantics. RoBERTa is a Transformer-based pretraining model. It is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus and able to seize the semantic information in the corpus. It performs well in many text generation and text understanding tasks. We train and test based on the Twitter comment data set. Compared with previous models, our model's test score is 0.031~0.1 points higher, which proves that our proposed model has better performance.","","978-1-7281-9264-2","10.1109/ICAML51583.2020.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9607135","Sentiment Support Phrases Extraction;RoBERTa;Transformer;Attention Mechanism","Social networking (online);Semantics;Blogs;Machine learning;Transformers;Task analysis","feature extraction;information retrieval;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","text sentiment support phrases extraction;emotional tendency;generative method;RoBERTa model;sentiment support words;extraction method;common indicators;sentence semantics;Transformer-based;large-scale corpus;semantic information;text generation;text understanding tasks","","1","","9","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
